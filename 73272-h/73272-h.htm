<p><span class="smcap large">It</span> is a pleasant duty to record my appreciation of
the assistance rendered me in the writing of these articles
by Miss Avery Strakosch (Mrs. W. K. Denham).
It was she who, at the suggestion of the editors of
the <i>Saturday Evening Post</i>, persuaded me to dictate
the series of eight articles that appeared in the <i>Post</i>
in the first part of 1927. The ninth was published
in the <i>Atlantic Monthly</i> in October 1927.</p>

<p>I cannot tell how much I am indebted to her, not
only for the form of the articles, but for a friendship
that began with the first article and will continue,
I trust, long after the last ceases to be read.</p>

<p class="c large sp">TALKING OF OLD BOOKS</p>


<p>“<span class="smcap large">Genius</span>?” The tall old man with the fan-shaped
beard looked eagerly at his companion, then settled
back more heavily against the rows and rows of old
books lining the walls to the ceiling on all sides of
the room. “Of course Edgar was a genius, but in
spite of being a gambler and a drunkard—in spite
of it, I tell you!”</p>

<p>The other, a thin man of lesser years, his long,
inquiring face meditative in the twilight, nodded.</p>

<p>“You are right,” he agreed. “But what difference
did it make? The only question is, would ‘The
Raven’ have been any greater without his gambling
and drinking? I doubt it.”</p>

<p>The argument was on, and my uncle, Moses
Polock, would lean forward now and again, waving
his coatless arms—he handled books easier in shirt
sleeves—in an effort to gain a point. His peculiarly
young and penetrating blue eyes glistened. Opposite,
George P. Philes, a noted editor and book collector,
twirled a gray moustache and goatee while balancing
in a tilted chair, listening calmly, and patiently relighting
a half-smoked cigar which went out often as
the verbal heat increased.</p>

<p>I would watch these two, dazed with their heated
words concerning authors and their works; hear them
make bookish prophecies, most of which came true.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</span>
A favorite subject was their neurotic friend, Edgar
Allan Poe. Both had befriended this singularly unfortunate
and great writer, and each had certain
contentions to make which led through the fire of
argument to the cooler and more even discussion of
reminiscences. But they did agree that it would take
less than fifty years after Poe’s death to make first
editions of his works the most valuable of all American
authors.</p>

<p>It was in 1885, when I was nine years old, that I
first felt the haunting atmosphere of Uncle Moses’
bookshop on the second floor of the bulging, red-brick
building on Commerce Street in old Philadelphia. At
that age I could hardly realize, spellbound as I was,
the full quality of mystery and intangible beauty
which becomes a part of the atmosphere wherever
fine books are brought together; for here was something
which called to me each afternoon, just as the
wharves, the water, and the ships drew other boys
who were delighted to get away from books the
moment school was out. Whatever it was,—some
glibly speak of it as bibliomania,—it entered my
bones then, and has grown out of all proportion ever
since. The long walk from the bookshop to my home
in the twilight, the moon, just coming up, throwing
long shadows across the white slab of Franklin’s
grave which I had to pass, was sometimes difficult;
but as I grew older I learned to shut my eyes against
imaginary fears and, in a valiant effort to be brave,
hurried past darkened corners and abysmal alleyways,
inventing a game by which I tried to visualize
the only touches of color in Uncle Moses’ musty,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</span>
dusty shop—occasional brilliantly bound volumes.
Running along, I also cross-examined myself on quotations
and dates from books and manuscripts through
which I had prowled earlier in the day, unwittingly
developing a memory which was often to stand me
in good stead.</p>

<p>My uncle’s appreciation of books showed itself long
before he took over the publishing and bookselling
business established in Philadelphia in 1780, just before
the close of the Revolution. Throughout his
youth books had been dear to him, and his father,
noting this, encouraged him to keep together the volumes
he prized most. Yet he gained local attention,
not as a book collector but as a publisher, when with a
certain amount of initiative he brought out the works
of the first American novelist, Charles Brockden
Brown. But I early had my suspicions of him as a
publisher. It seemed to me that he used the publishing
business as a literary cat’s-paw by which he might
conceal his real interest and love—searching for,
finding, and treasuring rare books.</p>

<p>After all, if one is in a trade, certain expectations
are held by the public; and the older Uncle Moses
grew the less willing he became to meet these expectations.
To publish books and sell them was one
phase; but to collect, and then to sell, he considered
a different and entirely personal affair. A poor young
man, Uncle Moses had acquired the business in an
almost magical manner. Jacob Johnson, the original
founder, began by publishing children’s books only.
But in 1800 he decided to branch out, and took a
partner, Benjamin Warner. Fifteen years later the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</span>
firm was sold out to McCarty and Davis. After
several successful years McCarty retired, and it was
then that Moses Polock was employed as a clerk.
They had spread out and were now publishing all
sorts of books. Davis became very fond of his clerk,
and when he died, in 1851, left him sufficient money
in his will to purchase the business for himself. Luck
was evidently with my uncle, for he made a great
deal of money in publishing Lindley Murray’s Grammar
and other schoolbooks of the time.</p>

<p>First as a publishing house and bookstore combined,
Uncle Moses’ shop became a meeting place
for publishers and writers. Here it was that the ill-fed
Poe came in 1835 to talk modestly of his writings
and hopes.</p>

<p>Such men as James Fenimore Cooper, William
Cullen Bryant, Noah Webster, and Herman Melville
might be seen going up or coming down the narrow
staircase leading to the second floor. George Bancroft,
the historian, came, too, and Eaton, who wrote
the Life of Jackson; George H. Boker, a distinguished
Philadelphia poet, Charles Godfrey Leland, of Hans
Breitmann Ballads note, and Donald G. Mitchell,
who wrote as Ik. Marvel, and many others—they
found their way along the uneven brick sidewalks of
Commerce Street. Gradually, however, it developed
into a rendezvous for the more leisured group of
collectors.</p>

<p class="caption">MOSES POLOCK IN HIS BOOKSHOP</p>
</div>

<p>Men—and occasionally a woman—who owned
many an interesting and valuable volume came to
browse and talk. Silent or voluble, enthusiastic or
suspiciously conservative, each had in mind some<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</span>
book, of Uncle Moses’ he hoped one day to possess.
For it took something more than money and coercion
to make this old man give up his treasures.
Even when he occasionally fell to this temptation and
sold the precious volume, in place of the original he
would make a pen-and-ink copy of the book, word for
word, so that it was typographically perfect. This
would take weeks to do, and only when he needed
money badly did he consent to part with the original.
I have some of these copies and treasure them as curiosities.
Not only months but very often years of tireless
perseverance were necessary to make him sell a
favorite volume. Equally interesting was that other
group which came daily—a group composed of
impecunious and peculiarly erratic book lovers,
found in book haunts the world over: a poverty-stricken
intellectual class, who in filling their
minds often forget to provide for their stomachs
as well.</p>

<p>All the memories of my childhood centre around
the secluded and dusty corners of this shop, where I
eavesdropped and prowled to my heart’s content.
My uncle, at first annoyed at having a little boy
about the place prying into musty papers and books,
eventually took delight in showing me rare editions
purchased by him at auctions and private sales. As
he grew older he became somewhat eccentric, and,
despite my extreme youth, insisted upon treating
me as a book lover and connoisseur, his own equal.
Although he lived to be a very old man, he retained
the most marvelous memory I have ever known. He
could tell without a moment’s hesitation the date of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</span>
a book, who the printer was, where it had been
found, any physical earmarks it might have, its
various vicissitudes, and how it had reached its
final destination.</p>

<p>Among the noted collectors who came to match
their wits and learning with my uncle was a younger
man, Clarence S. Bement, who developed into one of
the greatest American book experts. Even at that
time he had a wonderful collection, and I well remember
his subtle efforts to add to it constantly. He
would talk in a firm, low, rather musical voice, obviously
toned with persuasion, hoping to make his
friend part with some cherished volume he coveted.
As I watched Uncle Moses refuse, I saw a curiously
adamant and at the same time satisfied expression
spread over his features; I noticed, too, the dignity
of movement as he gravely took the volume from
Bement’s fingers to look at it, with that expressive
pride in ownership that verges on madness with many
people to whom possession can mean but one thing—books.</p>

<p>Samuel W. Pennypacker, who in later years became
governor of Pennsylvania, was another avid
book collector and constant habitué of the old Commerce
Street bookshop. His hobby was anything he
could lay his hands upon from the Franklin press.
He also collected all data relating to the early
Swedish settlers of Pennsylvania and his German
and Dutch ancestors, as well as any material concerning
the development of the state. A large man
he was, with serious eyes set in a rather square-shaped
head. But his voice fascinated me most of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</span>
all as it boomed about the shelves when he grew
excited, and took on an unforgettable Pennsylvania-Dutch
twang.</p>

<p>Pennypacker was a fervent admirer of George
Washington, and he had once heard of a letter
which General Washington wrote from one of the
scenes of his childhood, Pennypacker’s Mills. He
couldn’t seem to forget this letter, for he was
always talking about it, hoping to trace it to its
owner and eventually make it his own.</p>

<p>I shall never forget the day Uncle Moses told him
he had found and bought this letter. He handed it
to Pennypacker with a light of triumphant amusement
in his eyes. After reading it, Pennypacker put
it down on the table before him and, without raising
his eyes, said in a peculiarly exhausted way, “Polock,
I must have this letter. You can make any bargain
you choose, but I must have it!” Hardly waiting for
the other to reply, he rushed down the stairs, to
return a few moments later with two books under
his arm. My uncle’s blue eyes were but mocking
questions as he pushed them aside after glancing at
their title pages. They were two valuable books, but
not unusually so. Pennypacker had by this time
unbuttoned his coat, and I saw him take from an
inner pocket a thin, yellow envelope.</p>

<p>“These”—Pennypacker pointed to his two books
“and this.” He opened the envelope and gave
my uncle its contents. It, too, was a letter from
George Washington, yet no sign of emotion swept
the old man’s features as he read. But the exchange
was made rather quickly, I thought, and it would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</span>
have been, difficult to decide which bargainer was the
more satisfied. I have read both letters many times
since. The Pennypacker’s Mills letter was dated
September 29, 1777, and addressed: “On public
service, to the Honorable John Hancock, President
of Congress, Lancaster.” George Washington wrote
in part:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I shall move the Army four or five miles lower down
today from where we may reconnoitre and fix upon a
proper situation at such distance from the enemy as will
enable us to make an attack should we see a proper opening,
or stand upon the defensive till we obtain further reinforcements.
This was the opinion of a Council of
General Officers which I called yesterday.</p>

<p>I congratulate you upon the success of our Arms to
the Northward and if some accident does not put them
out of their present train, I think we may count upon the
total ruin of Burgoyne.</p>
</div>

<p>The letter which my uncle received was written
four years later from Philadelphia, in 1781, to Abraham
Skinner, Commissary General of Prisoners, and
was easily the more important, historically, of the
two, as General Washington discussed throughout
the surrender of Cornwallis and the exchange of
prisoners at Yorktown. He instructed General
Skinner not to consent to the exchange of Lord
Cornwallis under any conditions.</p>

<p>Even I, with but a short experience as a mere
onlooker in the collecting game, realized its greater
value. After my uncle’s death this Washington letter
sold for $925, and it rests to-day as one of the
treasures in the Pierpont Morgan collection.</p>

</div>

<p>A few years ago I bought back the Pennypacker’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</span>
Mills letter for $130 from Governor Pennypacker’s
estate. Because of the incident it recalls I would
never part with it.</p>

<p>When I was eleven years old I began book collecting
on my own. My first purchase was at an auction
in the old Henkels’s auction rooms on Chestnut
Street. It was an illustrated edition of <i>Reynard the
Fox</i>, and was knocked down to me for twenty-four
dollars. My enthusiasm rather than my financial
security swept me into this extravagance, and after
the sale I had to go to the auctioneer, Mr. Stan V.
Henkels, and confess that I was not exactly solvent.
At the same time I explained I was Moses Polock’s
nephew, instinctively feeling, I suppose, that such a
relationship might account for any untoward action
concerning books. I had hardly got the words out of
my frightened mouth when Mr. Henkels burst into a
fit of laughing which—although I was too young, too
scared and self-conscious to realize it at the time—was
the beginning of a lifelong friendship between us.</p>

<p>When he ceased laughing, he looked down at me,
a sombre little boy with a book under his shaking
arm, and said, “I’ve seen it start at an early age,
and run in families, but in all my experience this is
the very first baby bibliomaniac to come my way!”
With this admission he kindly consented to extend
credit, and trusted me for further payments, which
I was to make weekly from my school allowance.
Giving him all the money I possessed, ten dollars, I
marched from the auction room, feeling for the first
time in my life that swooning yet triumphant, that
enervating and at the same time heroic combination<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span>
of emotions the born bibliomaniac enjoys so intensely
with the purchase of each rare book.</p>

<p>Stan V. Henkels—no one dared to leave out the
middle initial—was a remarkable man. Even in his
young days he resembled an old Southern colonel,
the accepted picture we all have, a man of drooping
moustache, rather patrician nose, and longish hair
which he decorated with a large-brimmed, rusty black
hat of the Civil War period. He insisted he was an
unreconstructed rebel and was always willing to take
on anyone in a verbal battle about the Civil War.</p>

<p>By profession an auctioneer of books, Mr. Henkels
was the first person to make the dreary, uninteresting
work of auction catalogues into living, fascinating
literature, almost as exciting reading as fiction.
Previous to this, anyone wanting to find out what was
in a collection had little luck when searching through
a catalogue, beyond discovering names and dates.</p>

<p>Observing this, and that certain items whose contents
were of exceptional interest did not sell well,
Henkels decided to find out for himself what was
between the covers of the books he sold, and to
learn what was often told so confidentially in the
literary manuscripts and letters, and then to print
the most interesting data he could find about each
item. This was a great work in itself, and how he
found the leisure to give to it was a mystery. Thus
he brought in color and life, a human-interest setting,
which added thousands of dollars yearly to his business,
and which awakened feelings of gratitude in
many collectors.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="f5">

</div>

<p>Seven years after buying <i>Reynard the Fox</i> on the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</span>
installment plan, I made my first valuable literary
discovery. I was studying then at the University of
Pennsylvania, and books enthralled me to a disastrous
extent. I attended book sales at all hours of
the day and night; I neglected my studies; I bought
books whether I could afford them or not; I forgot
to eat, and did not consider sleep necessary at all.
The early stages of the book-collecting germ are not
the most virulent, but nevertheless they make themselves
felt!</p>

<p>This night I went to the Henkels’s auction room
several hours before the sale. I looked at many of
the books with great delight, sighed when I estimated
the prices they would bring, and was beginning to
feel rather despondent, when I happened to see a
bound collection of pamphlets in one corner of the
room.</p>

<p>Now for some unknown reason pamphlets, even
from my boyhood, have been a passion with me. I
cannot resist reading a pamphlet, whether it has
value or not. The potentialities between slim covers
play the devil with my imagination. It is true that
books are my real love, but pamphlets flaunt a certain
piquancy which I have never been able to resist.
One might call them the flirtations of book collecting.
I crossed to the corner, disturbed that I had not seen
the volume earlier in the evening, that I had so little
time to devote to it. But hurried as I felt,—it was
almost time for the sale to begin,—I came upon a
copy of Gray’s <i>Odes</i>. It was not only a first edition,
but the first book from Horace Walpole’s famous
Strawberry Hill Press, printed especially for him.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span>
Walpole had a weakness for gathering fame to his own
name by printing the works of certain famous contemporaries.
Delighted at finding this, I observed
the title page of a pamphlet, which was bound with
it. I could hardly believe my eyes! For in my
hands I held, quite by accident, the long-lost first
edition of Dr. Samuel Johnson’s famous <i>Prologue</i>,
which David Garrick recited the opening night of
the Drury Lane Theatre in London in 1747. Although
advertisements in the <i>General Advertiser</i> and <i>Gentleman’s
Magazine</i> of Doctor Johnson’s day announced
the sale of this work for the modest sum of sixpence,
no one had ever heard of a copy of this original
edition being in existence before or since. Boswell
made an allusion to it in his <i>Life of Johnson</i>, but that
was all that was known of this first issue of the little
masterpiece of “dramatick criticism.”</p>

<p>I closed my eyes in an effort to steady myself,
leaning heavily against the wall. I wanted to buy
this pamphlet more than I had ever wanted anything
in the world. A wealthy and noted collector entered
the room. I gave up hope. Again I looked at the
pamphlet, and as I read Doctor Johnson’s famous
line on Shakespeare, “And panting Time toil’d after
him in vain,” I wished that I might be weak enough
to take something which did not belong to me.</p>

<p>Suddenly my plans were made. I would have the
<i>Prologue</i>! I would do anything honorable to obtain
it. Having nothing but my future to mortgage I
desperately decided to offer that, whoever the purchaser
might be.</p>

<p>Mr. Henkels announced the usual terms of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</span>
sale and I gazed cautiously about the room; every
member of the audience was just waiting for that
volume of pamphlets, I knew. Finally it was put up,
and the very silence seemed to bid against me; when,
after two or three feeble counter bids, it became really
mine for the sum of $3.60, I sat as one in a trance.
The news soon spread among the experts of the exceptional
find I had made, and I had many offers for
it. Several years later, during my postgraduate course
at college, when I needed money very badly, a noted
collector dandled a check for $5000 before my eyes. It
was a difficult moment for me, but I refused the offer.
In my private library I retain this treasured volume.</p>

<p>One day previous to this I was in the auction
rooms when a white-haired negro said Mr. Henkels
had something interesting to show me if I would go
to the top floor. I found him standing by an open
window fronting Chestnut Street, exhibiting to
several curious customers a small gold locket which
had belonged to George Washington. It had been authenticated
by his heirs, and also the gray lock of
hair enclosed within it. As I joined the others, Mr.
Henkels opened the locket and held it out for inspection.
At that moment an unexpected gust of
wind blew into the room, and, sweeping about, took
the curl very neatly from its resting place. So
quickly did it happen it was a moment or so before
we realized that the prized lock had been wafted out
of the window. Then suddenly we all ran to the
stairs and raced four flights into the street below.
Up and down, searching the block, the gutters, and
the crevices of stone and brick, we sought the lost<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</span>
lock of the Father of our Country. After an hour,
or so it seemed, we gave it up as useless. As we
returned to the entrance of the rooms the old negro
employé came out.</p>

<p>“Wait a minute!” Henkels exclaimed, as an idea
came to him.</p>

<p>He grabbed the ancient and surprised servant by
the hair. Selecting a choice curly ringlet, he clipped
it off with his pocketknife, then placed it carefully in
George Washington’s locket, closing it tightly.</p>

<p>Several days later I saw the locket put up for sale.
The bidding was brisk, and the buyer later expressed
himself as being exceptionally lucky. But Henkels,
who was the soul of honor, could not listen quietly
for long. He told of his, as well as Nature’s prank
with the original lock of hair, and offered to refund
the money. The purchaser refused, saying he had
given no thought to the contents anyway; that his
interest lay only in the locket.</p>

<p>It is almost incredible, the number of stories that
circulate about the civilized world containing misstatements
and garbled information about the values
and prices of old books. I am sometimes amused, at
other times annoyed, to read in the daily papers
statements of prices I and other collectors are supposed
to have bought and sold books for. Reporters
who descend upon us hurriedly to verify the story of
some unusual sale can be divided into two classes—overenthusiastic
and bored. The former often exaggerate
the amount paid for a book and its value;
the latter are likely to be careless about details and
set them down incorrectly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</span></p>

<p>When I bought a Gutenberg Bible for $106,000
last spring, I was careful to read and correct the
original announcement made of the purchase. Such
an event was too important in the history of book
collecting to be misstated. Even then, many papers
carried a story which gave the impression that this
was the only Gutenberg Bible in existence, when
there are about forty-two known copies—differing
in condition, of course. But collectors themselves
have often been at fault for the broadcasting of misinformation,
for they seldom take time to go out of
their way to correct wrong impressions.</p>

<p>It is only in the past few generations that collectors
have taken great care of their treasures—a lucky
change, too, for had they all pawed books about,
wearing them to shreds in the scholastic manner,
few rare volumes would have been saved for us to-day.
Acquisitiveness, that noble urge to possess
something the other fellow hasn’t or can’t get, is
often the direct cause of assembling vast, extraordinary
libraries.</p>

<p>Book lovers who were contemporaries of Moses
Polock treated him as though he would live forever.
It has been noted that those who collect things outlive
people who do not. No one notices this so much,
perhaps, as the collector himself who has his eye on
the collection of another, or the book collector who
cannot sleep well at night for the thought of a valuable
first edition he would like to own. Book collectors,
I make no exceptions, are buzzards who stretch
their wings in anticipation as they wait patiently for
a colleague’s demise; then they swoop down and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</span>
ghoulishly grab some long-coveted treasure from the
dear departed’s trove.</p>

<p>Two years before my uncle’s death I gave up my
fellowship in English at the University of Pennsylvania
to enter professionally the sport of book collecting
and the business of selling. Uncle Moses was
extremely pleased to have me as a competitor. He
often said he believed I had all the necessary requisites
for collecting, an excellent memory, perseverance,
taste, and a fair knowledge of literature.
Alas, all requisites but one—money! He thought
if I were fortunate enough to acquire that, I would
also have the other virtue—courage: the courage to
pay a high price for a good book and to refuse a
poor one at any price. And I was fortunate. Two
gentlemen whose interest in books was as intense as
mine made it possible for me to establish myself as a
bookseller. The first, Clarence S. Bement, possessed
a glorious collection over which he had spent years
of constant study and search. All collectors were
eager to secure his volumes, each being fine and rare.
As a silent partner he was invaluable to me in many
ways, and with the second, Joseph M. Fox, spurred
me on to collecting the choicest books and manuscripts
as they came on the market, pointing out
the fact that at all times there is a demand for
the finest things. Mr. Fox, one of the most lovable
of men, lived in a very old Colonial house called
Wakefield, in the suburbs of Philadelphia, in which
he had discovered wonderful Revolutionary letters
and documents.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="f6">

<p>It is difficult to know at what moment one becomes
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</span>a miser of books. For many years preceding his death,
Uncle Moses kept a fireproof vault in the rear of his
office, where he secreted rarities no one ever saw.
His books were as real to him as friends. He feared
showing the most precious lest he part with one in a
moment of weakness. One of the amusing incidents
of his life was that he had sold a copy of the Bradford
<i>Laws of New York</i>, published in 1694, to Doctor
Brinley for sixteen dollars, and many years later he
had seen it sell at the Brinley sale for $1600. The
money consideration did not cause his regret so much
as the fact that he had felt an affection for this
volume, which had rested upon his shelves for more
than thirty years. By an amusing turn of the wheel
of chance, which my uncle might have foreseen, the
same volume would be worth to-day $20,000!</p>

<p>At the death of my uncle, in 1903, I came into
possession of some of his wonderful books; others were
purchased by private buyers and are to-day parts of
various famous libraries. I was greatly thrilled when,
as administrator of his estate, I entered his secret
vault for the first time in my life. In the half light
I stumbled against something very hard on the floor.
Lighting a match, I looked down, to discover a curious
bulky package. Examining it more closely, I
found it was a bag of old gold coins. A reserve
supply cautiously hoarded, no doubt, to buy further
rarities.</p>

<p>My uncle’s estate included several books from the
library of George Washington, the finest of which
was a remarkable copy of the <i>Virginia Journal</i>, published
in Williamsburg, which I still have. Washington<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</span>
was one of the three presidents who collected
books in an intelligent manner. There have been
presidents who loved books—the late Theodore
Roosevelt, for example—but who were not real
collectors. It is always interesting to hazard a guess
at a great man’s personal likes by noting the titles
in his library. In the past years I have bought other
books from Washington’s collection. There is <i>The
History of America</i> by William Robertson, in two
volumes, Brown’s <i>Civil Law, Inland Navigation</i>,
Jenkinson’s <i>Collections of Treaties</i>, eight volumes of
the <i>Political State of Europe</i>, a four-volume course of
lectures by Winchester on the <i>Prophecies That
Remain to be Fulfilled</i>—in this last Washington
wrote: “From the author to G. Washington.” These
are a heavy literary diet, somewhat one-sided when
placed next to <i>Epistles for the Ladies</i>, which was also
his. Each volume has the signature on the title page—“George
Washington”—with his armorial bookplate
pasted inside the front cover. There were
doubtless book borrowers in those days, too, whose
memories and consciences might be jogged at sight
of the owner’s name. Another, a gift to Washington,
is a collection of poems “written chiefly during the
late war,” by Philip Freneau, one of the few very
early American poets whose work has survived.
On the title page in Freneau’s hand, with his signature,
is written: “General Washington will do the
author the honor to accept a copy of his poems, as a
small testimony of the disinterested veneration he
entertains for his character.”</p>

<p>The books belonging to Martha Washington are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</span>
few, merely because she was not a great reader, and
the common-sense title of the one book of hers which
I have—<i>Agriculture of Argyll County</i>—would lead
one to think of her as a practical woman rather
interested in rural activities.</p>

<p>The collecting passion is as old as time. Even
book collecting, which many believe to be a comparatively
recent development, can be traced back
to the Babylonians. They, with their passion for
preserving records on clay tablets, could hardly go
in for all the little niceties, such as original paper
boards or beautifully tooled bindings, but they were
collectors nevertheless.</p>

<p>Among the early individual book collectors such
colorful names as Jean Grolier, De Thou, Colbert,
and the Cardinals Richelieu and Mazarin shine forth.
Jean Grolier, a collector of the late fifteenth and the
early sixteenth century, now considered the patron
saint of modern book collectors, showed unusual
vision in selecting his books. Though many libraries
of that time are both remarkable and valuable, their
worth varies. But every collector is keen to possess
a Grolier volume, and at each sale the prices increase.
He evidently read what he selected, and his taste
showed that he had education and discernment.
Aldus Manutius, the most famous printer of that
day, dedicated books to him and printed certain
works for him on special paper. Aldus was the first
to popularize the small-sized book, and that is why
many from the Grolier collection are easier to handle
than the more gross volumes from other early
libraries.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</span></p>

<p>Grolier’s generous disposition is indicated by the
fact that he has either written in, or had stamped on
the outside of the truly exquisite bindings, “Io
Grolierii et Amicorum”—his books were for himself
and his friends too. Many people have since copied
this inscription on their bookplates. The Grolier
family were book lovers, and his library was kept
intact for three generations. Not until one hundred
and sixteen years after his death was it sold, and
although many were bought by other famous collectors,
old records show that some disappeared
entirely. It is just such knowledge that keeps the
true bibliophile living in hopes—a long-missing
Grolier might turn up any time, anywhere.</p>

<p>About the time of the discovery of America a
book came out called <i>The Ship of Fools</i>, by one
Sebastian Brant. In it was an attack on the book
fool: a satire on the passion of collecting, in which
the author said that the possession of books was but
a poor substitute for learning. That phrase which
the layman reader asks the book collector so often
with a smirk of condescension, “So you really read
them?” undoubtedly originated then. The real book
collector, with suppressed murder in his heart, smiles
acquiescence, assuming an apologetic air for his
peculiar little hobby. His invisible armor is his
knowledge, and he has been called a fool so often
he glories in it. He can afford to have his little
joke. So much for this threadbare gibe.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="f7">
<img src="images/fig7.jpg" alt="grolier">
<p class="caption">GROLIER BINDING</p>
</div>

<p>Cardinal Richelieu, according to history, sought
relaxation from the cares of state in his love of books.
His huge library was got together in many ways.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</span>
Sometimes he bought books; he sent two learned
men on the road, one to Germany and the other to
Italy, to collect both printed and manuscript works.
Often he would exchange volumes with other collectors,
and one can imagine the covert smile of
satisfaction on this ecclesiastical politician’s lips
whenever he got the better of a bargain.</p>

<p>Of course there was always a way to get a rare
work, whether the owner cared to part with it or not,
by an off-with-his-head policy of intimidation. After
the taking of La Rochelle the red-robed Richelieu
topped off the victory by helping himself to the entire
library of that city. Even though he was something
of a robber, his ultimate motive was good—he
planned to establish a reference library for all qualified
students. Yet it was his nephew, the inheritor of
his library, who carried out these plans posthumously.
He willed it to the Sorbonne, with a fund to keep up
the collection and to add to it according to the needs
and progress of the times.</p>

<p>Cardinal Mazarin had the appreciation of books
instilled in him from his boyhood, when he attended
a Jesuit school in Rome. Following in the footsteps
of the famous Richelieu, it was necessary to carry
out many of his predecessor’s policies. One of these
was to weaken the French nobles, who ruled enormous
country estates, by destroying their feudal
castles. Thus Mazarin, a great but wily character,
took his books where he found them. Eventually his
library grew to be a famous one, which he generously
threw open to the literary men of the day. Fortunately
the men who followed Mazarin kept his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</span>
collection intact, and to-day, in Paris, one may see
the great Mazarin Library on the left bank of the
Seine.</p>

<p>Colbert, first as Mazarin’s secretary, and later a
great political leader on his own account, also collected
a fine library in perhaps a more legitimate
manner than his patron. He arranged for the consuls
representing France in every part of Europe to
secure any remarkable works they might hear of.
Colbert not only offered the use of his collection to
such of his contemporaries as Molière, Corneille,
Boileau, and Racine, but pensioned these men as well.</p>

<p>De Thou, also a Frenchman, of the latter half of
the sixteenth and the early seventeenth century, had
the finest library of his time. His thousands upon
thousands of volumes included many bought from
the Grolier collection, and collectors’ interest in
them has never lessened. De Thou was the truest
type of book lover. He had not one but several
copies of each book he felt a particular affection for;
he ordered them printed on the best paper obtainable,
expressly for himself. His bindings are richly
beautiful, of the finest leathers, exquisitely designed.
They are easily recognizable, as his armorial stamp,
with golden bees, is on the sides, and the back is
marked with a curious cipher made from his initials.
Most of the contents treat of profound but interesting
subjects. He was a real student, and wrote an
extensive history of his time in Latin. Here is an
example of inherited passion for books. His mother’s
brother and his father were both book lovers.</p>

<p>It is a general belief that books are valuable merely<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</span>
because they are old. Age, as a rule, has very little
to do with actual value. I have never announced the
purchase of a noted old book without having my
mail flooded for weeks afterward with letters from
all over the world. Each correspondent tells me of
opportunities I am losing by not going immediately
to his or her home to see, and incidentally buy, “a
book which has been in my family over one hundred
years.”</p>

<p>I receive more than thirty thousand letters about
books every year. Each letter is read carefully and
answered. There are many from cranks. But it is
not hard to spot these even before opening the envelope,
when addressed, as one was recently from
Germany,“Herrn Doktor Rosenbach, multi-millionaire,
Amerika.” Indeed, the greater number of letters
about books are from Germany. One man in Hamburg
wrote me of a book he had for sale, then ended
by saying he also had a very fine house he would
like me to buy, because he felt sure, if I saw it, his
elegant garden would appeal to me for the use of
my patients! Many people write me, after I have
purchased a book at a high price, and say they have
something to offer “half as old at half the price!”</p>

<p>Yet one out of every two thousand letters holds a
possibility of interest. I followed up a letter from
Hagenau not long ago, to discover—the copy was
sent me on approval—a first edition of <i>Adonais</i>,
Shelley’s lament on the death of Keats, in the blue
paper wrappers in which it was issued. There are
only a few copies known in this original condition.
I bought it by correspondence for a reasonable price.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</span>
It is worth at least $5000. On the other hand, I
have often made a long journey to find nothing but
an inferior copy of a late edition of some famous
work. I once heard of a first edition of Hubbard’s
<i>Indian Wars</i>, in Salem, Massachusetts. When I
arrived there the family who owned it brought out
their copy, unwrapping it with much ceremony from
swathings of old silk. Immediately I saw it was a
poor reprint made in the nineteenth century, although
the original was printed in 1677.</p>

<p>But luck had not deserted me entirely that day.
As my train was not due for an hour, I wandered
about the city. In passing one of the many antique
shops which all New England cities seem to possess
by the gross, I noticed a barrow on the sidewalk
before it. In this barrow were thrown all sorts and
conditions of books. Yet the first one I picked up
was a first edition of Herman Melville’s <i>Moby Dick</i>,
worth about $150, which I bought for two dollars.</p>

<p>Speaking of this copy of <i>Moby Dick</i> reminds me
of another, a more valuable one, which I prize in my
private library. One day about five years ago John
Drinkwater, the English poet and dramatist, and I
were lunching at his home in London. Talking of
books and the ever-interesting vicissitudes of collecting
them, he told me of his <i>Moby Dick</i>, found one
day, by chance, in a New York bookstore for but a
few dollars. It was a presentation copy from the
author to his friend, Nathaniel Hawthorne, to whom
the book was dedicated, and had Hawthorne’s signature
on the dedication leaf. When Mr. Drinkwater
told me of this I became restless; I wanted this copy as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</span>
much as I had ever wanted any other book, and there
was nothing for me to do but tell him so. I offered
him twenty times what he had paid for it, and to
my surprise and delight he generously let me have it.</p>

<p>Why age alone should be thought to give value to
most collectible objects, including furniture, pictures,
and musical instruments, I don’t know. However,
it is a great and popular fallacy. The daily prayer
of all true collectors should begin with the words,
“beauty, rarity, condition,” and last of all, “antiquity.”
But books differ from other antiques in that
their ultimate value depends upon the intrinsic merit
of the writer’s work. A first edition of Shakespeare,
for instance, will always command an ever-increasing
price. The same is true of first editions of Dante,
Cervantes, or Goethe. These writers gave something
to the world and to life—something of which one
always can be sure.</p>

<p>Very often the greatness of an author, the value
of what he has written, is not realized until years
have gone by. Vital truths are sometimes seen more
clearly in perspective. A first folio of Shakespeare’s
<i>Comedies, Histories and Tragedies</i> was sold in 1864
to the late Baroness Burdett-Coutts, who paid what
was considered an enormous price—£716—for it.
Yet only fifty-eight years later my brother Philip
bought the same folio for me at Sotheby’s in London
for £8600, Shakespeare’s writings having increased
in value more than twelve times in a little more
than half a century.</p>

<p>The fallacy of thinking that age is of major importance
in judging a book should be corrected by every<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</span>
book lover. Age? Why, there are many books of the
fifteenth century which command small prices in
the auction rooms to-day, while certain volumes
brought out a decade ago are not only valuable but
grow more so with each passing year. A first edition
of A. A. Milne’s <i>When We Were Very Young</i>, printed
two years ago, is already more precious than some
old tome, such as a sermon of the 1490’s by the
famous teacher, Johannes Gerson, the contents of
which are and always will be lacking in human or
any other kind of interest.</p>

<p>The inception of any great movement, whether
material or spiritual, is bound to be interesting,
according to its relative importance. The Gutenberg
Bible, leaving aside the question of its artistic merit
and the enormous value of its contents, as the first
printed book is of the greatest possible significance.
But it so happens that this wonderful Bible is also
one of the finest known examples of typography.
No book ever printed is more beautiful than this
pioneer work of Gutenberg, the first printer, although
it was issued almost five hundred years ago. It has
always seemed an interesting point to me that
printing is the only art which sprang into being full-blown.
Later years brought about a more uniform
appearance of type, but aside from this we have
only exceeded the early printers in speed of execution.
Enormous value is added to some of these
earliest books because they are the last word in the
printer’s art.</p>

<p>The first books printed on subjects of universal
interest are the rarest “firsts” of all for the collector.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</span>
These include early romances of chivalry, of which
few copies are found to-day. They are generally
in very poor condition, as their popular appeal
was tremendous, and they were literally read to
pieces. They were really the popular novels of the
period. The ones which come through the stress of
years successfully are extremely rare. For instance,
there are the Caxtons.</p>

<p>William Caxton was the first printer in England,
and the first to print books in the English language.
When he brought out the second edition of Chaucer’s
<i>Canterbury Tales</i> in 1484, with its fascinating woodcut
illustrations, it was literally devoured by contemporary
readers. This and other publications of
Caxton were very popular—he evidently had a
good eye for best sellers—and now a perfect Caxton
is difficult to find.</p>

<p>One of the finest Caxtons in existence is <i>Le Morte
d’ Arthur</i> by Sir Thomas Malory, published in 1485.
This perfect copy, this jewel among Caxtons, sold
at the dispersal of the library of the Earl of Jersey
in 1885 for £1950, approximately $9500. Now this
is an excellent example of a book increasing in value
for its pristine, perfect state as well as for its alluring
contents. Twenty-six years later it brought
$42,800 at the Hoe sale. It is now one of the treasures
adorning the Pierpont Morgan Library.</p>

<p>The first editions of books which have that quality
so glibly called to-day sex appeal, such as Boccaccio’s
<i>Decameron</i>, and his <i>Amore di Florio e di Bianchafiore</i>—a
wicked old romance of the fifteenth century,
truly the first snappy story—are firsts of which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</span>
there are but few left for our edification. They are
extremely precious to the collector, no matter what
their condition. The first book on murder; the first
book on medicine or magic; the first Indian captivity;
the first music book, the first newspaper, the
first published account of lace making, or the comparatively
modern subject, shorthand—the first
book on any subject marking the advance of civilization,
is always valuable.</p>

<p>One of the rarest and most interesting books is
the first sporting book, <i>The Book of Hunting and
Hawking</i>, printed at St. Albans, in 1486, by an unknown
man, called, for convenience of classification,
the Schoolmaster Printer. Women were sports writers
even in those days, for this record was written by
a woman, Dame Juliana Barnes, sometimes known
as Berners. A copy was sold in the Hoe sale in 1911,
for $12,000, to Mr. Henry E. Huntington, who formed
one of the few great collections of the world. Nearly
all of the few existing copies of this work are now in
this country. Another one, the Pembroke copy,
which I now own, sold for £1800 in 1914. As it is the
last one that can ever come on the market, heaven
only knows what it is worth to-day. Like some
other famous firsts, it has several novel merits, being
one of the first books to contain English poetry, and
the first English book to be illustrated with pictures
printed in color. This and Walton’s <i>The Compleat
Angler</i> are the two greatest sporting books of all time.
Yet, because there are more copies of the latter
in existence, a fine copy of the first edition in the
original binding is worth not more than $8500 to-day.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</span></p>

<p>Another tremendously rare book is the much-read
<i>Pilgrim’s Progress</i>. No work, with the exception of
the Bible, has enjoyed greater popularity all through
the years than this powerful imaginative and moral
tale. I have almost every edition of it, in every
language. A best seller for years after the author’s
death, and a very good seller to-day, too, the early
editions were really read to bits. So it is hardly
surprising that only six perfect copies of the first
edition exist. A few months ago a copy sold at
Sotheby’s in London for £6800. The most beautiful
one in existence is that famed copy I purchased
eighteen months ago from Sir George Holford. I
believe if one of the half-dozen perfect first editions
were offered in public sale to-day it would easily bring
from $40,000 to $45,000.</p>

<p>About five years ago the illness of an English
barber’s wife brought to light a first edition of <i>Pilgrim’s
Progress</i> which was in good condition, except
that it lacked two pages. In the little town of Derby
lived this barber, daily plying the trade of his ancestors.
Between the lathering and the gossiping he
found little time and inclination to read, but sometimes
when business was not so brisk as usual he
listlessly ran through a small stack of books which
he inherited along with the shop. Old-fashioned in
text, some with odd pictures, and leaves missing, he
thought them rather funny, and occasionally showed
them to customers who shared his amusement. One
day someone suggested the books were interesting
because they were old, and—following the popular
fallacy of which I have spoken—must be valuable.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</span>
He had heard of a man who once paid two pounds for
a book!</p>

<p>But the barber shrugged his shoulders and said he
had plenty to do without chasing about trying to sell
old, worn-out books. Then came a day when his wife
took to her bed and the doctor was hurriedly sent for.
While waiting for him the barber tried to think of
some way he might amuse his wife. As he went into
the shop his eyes fell first upon the books on a low
shelf. When the doctor arrived he found his patient’s
bed loaded down with books, and she was reading a
copy of <i>The Pilgrim’s Progress</i>. The doctor was a
lover of books in a small way; he felt there was something
unusual about this copy. He insisted it should
be sent to Sotheby’s in London for valuation. Even
then the barber believed he was wasting both time
and money.</p>

<p>Finally Sotheby’s received a package accompanied
by a letter, painstakingly written in an illiterate
hand, with small <i>i</i>’s throughout, and guiltless of
punctuation. He was sending this copy, he wrote,
because a friend was foolish enough to think it might
be worth something. Of course it wasn’t. He had
inherited it from his people, and his people were poor.
They couldn’t have had anything valuable to leave
him. If, as he believed, it was worthless, would they
please throw it away, and not bother to return it, or
waste money answering him? I don’t know what his
direct emotional reaction was when they replied saying
his old book was worth at least £900—more
than $4000—and that they would place it in their
next sale. Perhaps he was stunned for a time. Anyway,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</span>
weeks passed before they received a rather incoherent
reply. I happened to be in London when
it was sold, and I paid £2500—about $12,000—for
the copy. I later learned that the barber was
swamped for months with letters from old friends he
had never heard of before, each with a valuable book
to sell him.</p>

<p>As collectors grow older, they find it is better to
buy occasionally and at a high price than to run about
collecting tuppenny treasures. There is seldom any
dispute about the worth of a rare book. Many collectors,
however, feel collecting has a value other
than monetary; it keeps men young, and as the years
pass it proves to be a new type of life insurance.</p>

<p>The late Mr. W. A. White of New York, until his
death a few months ago, was as vigorous at eighty-three
as he had been thirty years before. He combined
a quality of youth with his extraordinary
knowledge of books and literature. His wonderful
library would take away the load of years from a
Methuselah. Even to read over the partial list of
his treasures, which was recently published, would
have a distinctly rejuvenating effect. Mr. Henry E.
Huntington was another successful man who practically
gave up his business interests to devote himself
to the invigorating pastime of book collecting.
He collected so rapidly that no young man could
follow in his steps! Even my uncle Moses grew
younger and younger as he sat year after year surrounded
by books.</p>

<p>Rare books are a safe investment; the stock can
never go down. A market exists in every city of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</span>
world. New buyers constantly crop up. The most
ordinary, sane, and prosaic type of business man will
suddenly appear at your door, a searching look in his
eye, a suppressed tone of excitement in his voice.
Like the Ancient Mariner, he takes hold of you to
tell his story—for he has suddenly discovered book
collecting. And if it happens to be at the end of a
very long day, you feel like the Wedding Guest,
figuratively beating your breast the while you listen.
He returns again and again, enthralled by this new
interest which takes him away from his business. If
he is wealthy, he already may be surfeited with luxuries
of one sort or another; but here is something akin
to the friendship of a charming and secretive woman.
He takes no risk of becoming satiated; there is no
possibility of being bored; always some new experience
or unexpected discovery may be lurking just
around the corner of a bookshelf.</p>

<p class="c large sp">A MILLION DOLLAR BOOKSHELF</p>


<p><span class="smcap large">One</span> of my early memories concerns a cold winter
night in Philadelphia. I was a little boy of thirteen.
Uncle Moses and I had been together undisturbed
the entire evening, for the weather was so bitterly
cold not one of his book-loving cronies dared venture
out. With the shop door locked and the shutters
tightly drawn, we sat close to the little wood stove,
in the dim light of an oil lamp, while I listened, fascinated,
to endless tales about books—how this
one was lost and that one found. To this handsome
old patriarch books were more vital than people;
with ease he held my boyish imagination until I
was almost afraid to glance back at the shadowed
shelves.</p>

<p>He told me the story of a man in England, a
collector, who heard of some Shakespeare folios in
Spain; of how, after months of inquiries and exciting
adventures, he at last journeyed to a castle in the
Pyrenees. There he found an ancient Spanish grandee
leaning forward before a great fireplace, feeding
the fire with torn bits of paper on which, to his
horror, he beheld English printing; how he tore them
from the old man’s fingers—the remains of a second
Shakespeare folio he had sought and found too late!
As Uncle Moses spoke, he arose to throw casually
some sheets of an old Pennsylvania <i>Journal</i> into the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</span>
stove, while I watched, tense and frightened for fear
they, too, might be of value!</p>

<p>At last, as the clock in Independence Hall struck
midnight, we felt our way down the dark narrow
stairs to the street. In his hand Uncle Moses clasped
a cherished volume of the first edition of Fielding’s
<i>Tom Jones</i>, to read when he reached home. The uneven
sidewalks were dangerously glazed with ice; as
we crept unsteadily toward the corner we were relieved
to see a lonely carriage passing, and hailed it.
The streets were even worse than the sidewalks, and
the horse went his way skiddingly. We came to a
bridge which shone like a polished mirror in the moonlight.
We were halfway across when suddenly the
horse lurched, and both Uncle Moses and I were
thrown forward. In the confusion Uncle Moses
dropped his precious book. Out it went, slithering
along the icy way. I started to climb down after it,
but was stopped by a firm hand.</p>

<p>Slowly Uncle Moses got out, walked uncertainly
forward. He had not gone two steps before he lost
his balance. As he fell I cried aloud in alarm and the
driver turned, amazed. Up Uncle Moses got, and
down he went again; yet with each fall he came nearer
and nearer his book, which lay open face downward
in the frozen gutter. At last he reached it and, after
securely placing it in his overcoat pocket, started
the perilous way back. But he had learned the trick;
instead of trying to walk, he crouched down on all
fours, and, dignified dean of booksellers that he was,
crawled cautiously toward the carriage. Suddenly
the sight of him there struck me as being the funniest<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</span>
thing I had ever seen! The glassy bridge, the unreal
light, and statuesque Uncle Moses telescoping like
a huge caterpillar toward me! I snickered, then burst
out laughing. The old driver followed suit, and our
rude guffaws echoed across the bridge, through the
deserted streets. Uncle Moses’ dark eyes snapped
as he reached the carriage.</p>

<p>“You should have let me get your book,” I said
shamefacedly. “You might have broken your leg!”</p>

<p>“I would risk breaking two legs for this book,” he
growled back, and we drove on.</p>

<p>In the years which followed I have known men to
hazard their fortunes, go long journeys halfway about
the world, forget friendship, even lie, cheat, and
steal, all for the gain of a book. Improbable as it
sounds, there was a man once who murdered so that
he might possess a volume for which he had long
yearned.</p>

<p>It was in the valuable library of the monastery at
Poblet, near Tarragona, just a century ago, that Don
Vincente, a Spanish monk, developed his unholy love
for books. Years of religious training did not prevent
him from seizing every chance to plunder his
own and other monastery libraries which were thrown
open in a political upheaval of the time. As confusion
spread, he found opportunities to take the books
he coveted most, and then he vanished. But sometime
later he appeared in Barcelona, the proprietor
of a bookshop. The one volume he had worshiped
at a distance and longed to own was a work of Lamberto
Palmart, published in Valencia in 1482. It
had been in the collection of a Barcelona advocate<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</span>
for years, and at the dispersal of his estate was offered
at auction. It was understood to be the only one of
its kind known.</p>

<p>Don Vincente went to the sale and staked every
cent he possessed on it; but a competitor, Augustino
Paxtot, outbid him by fourteen pesetas. The ex-monk
grew white with fury, threatening revenge as
he left the room. When, a few nights later, Paxtot’s
house burned to the ground and he perished with it,
several friends recalled Don Vincente’s threats. He
was reported to the police, his shop searched, and
the rare Palmart volume found. Even when he was
arrested, Don Vincente made no effort to deny his
guilt. All he seemed interested in was the fate of the
little book which had brought disgrace upon him.
During the trial his lawyer, making a valiant effort
to save him, announced that another copy of the Palmart
volume had been found in a Paris library, a few
days previous to the alleged crime. It could not be
proved, he argued, that the copy in question was the
one recently auctioned. But Don Vincente, hearing
his book was not unique, burst into violent weeping
and showed no further interest in the trial. Alone at
night in his cell, and before the court during the final
days of his trial, his only words of regret were, “Alas,
alas! My copy is not unique!”</p>

<p>To-day book collectors are less violent, although
they have their moments when they seethe and
writhe inwardly! Just go to any book sale and observe
the expressions of competitive buyers—faces
that are usually marvelous poker portraits become
sharply distorted; eyes which ordinarily indulge in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</span>
an almost studied innocence shoot sudden darts of
fire. Whenever I attend an important sale I make
it a point to look neither to the right nor to the left!</p>

<p>I have often been asked why collectors are so
enamored of first editions. This is almost unanswerable,
because the whole question of first editions
hinges on a matter of sentiment, of feeling, almost
of emotion. How can one explain the sentimental
affections? A first edition is almost as much the
original work of its author as the painting is of an
artist. I suppose there are people—I’ve been told
there are intelligent people—who would just as
soon have an edition of Keats’s <i>Poems</i>, for example,
well printed on good paper, in a handsome modern
binding, as a first edition in its original boards! I
only hope I shall never meet them.</p>

<p>Collectors are very ardent on the subject of association
copies, or books inscribed or annotated by
the authors themselves. To think that John Keats
may have held in his slender white fingers your first
edition of his poems; that his luminous eyes, already
sunken from the inroads of his fatal illness, may have
lingered over the very pages of the copy you possess—this
is enough to thrill the Devil himself!</p>

<p>Miss Amy Lowell was, as all the world knows, devoted
to Keats. She believed herself spiritually
attuned to him. I shall never forget the last time I
visited at her home near Boston. After a delightful
dinner, we went into her library, where we lighted
our cigars and talked. She told me of her colossal
work on Keats, which, fortunately for her peace of
mind, she lived to see published. Then followed a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</span>
silence as the blue haze of smoke enveloped her.
Suddenly she leaned toward me and, with an excited
brightness in her eyes, said, “Doctor, there is
a certain book I want more than anything in the
world! Keats’s own copy of Shakespeare, with his
notes through it.”</p>

<p>I put my hand in my pocket and smiled. By one
of those unusual chances which really do make truth
stranger than fiction, I had that very volume in my
pocket. She caught her breath and grew quite pale
with joy as I handed it to her.</p>

<p>At the Frederickson sale in New York, nearly
thirty years ago, Mr. Harry B. Smith bought Shelley’s
own copy of <i>Queen Mab</i>. The poet had presented
this to his future wife, Mary Wollstonecraft Godwin,
with the wooing inscription, “You see, Mary, I
have not forgotten you.” When Mr. Smith was going
out of the salesroom, an old gentleman whom he had
never seen before stopped him. Brushing tears from
his eyes, he asked if he might merely hold the book in
his hands for a moment. The history of this same
copy, I think, is interesting. General Brayton Ives
bought it in 1888 from a London dealer for £20—less
than $100. Three years afterward it was sold
at the dispersal of the General’s library to Mr. Frederickson
for not quite one hundred per cent gain—$190.
But when Mr. Smith, the next possessor,
bought it, the price jumped to $650. Sometime later
I purchased his “Sentimental Library,” as he gracefully
termed it, and I also trembled when first holding
this <i>Queen Mab</i> in my hands. In 1914 I sold it to
Mr. William K. Bixby of St. Louis for $12,500. Then
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</span>it finally passed, as so many of the finest books did,
into Mr. Huntington’s collection, where it will remain
for all time.</p>

</div>

<p>Buxton Forman’s copy of <i>Queen Mab</i>, the one
Shelley had kept for himself and inestimably enriched
by changes and additions for a later edition, is now
in the remarkable collection of Mr. Jerome D. Kern
of New York.</p>

</div>

<p>Still another, also containing Shelley’s precious
notes in his own hand, is in that treasure-house of
rarities, the library of Mr. Thomas J. Wise. His
catalogue, now wanting only the last volume, is
more absorbingly interesting to book lovers than
most works of fiction.</p>

<p>When I was in London in 1925 a friend told me a
story which he thought something of a joke on me.
As he browsed, one fine spring day, through some<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</span>
books in a bookstall, he noticed a young man also
reading. Suddenly a clerk from inside the shop came
out, exhibiting a cheap dog’s-eared copy of Margot
Asquith’s autobiography.</p>

<p>“How much?” asked the young man cautiously.
The clerk replied, “Fourpence.”</p>

<p>“Fourpence,” repeated the other, scandalized.
“Who do you think I am—Dr. Rosenbach?”</p>

<p>A few days before, I had bought in London, at
auction, a copy of Richard Baxter’s <i>Call to the Unconverted</i>,
at the Royal Society’s sale. I had to pay
£6800, or about $34,000, for it. It was a beautiful
copy, printed in Cambridge, Massachusetts, in 1664,
and the only one known. Translated into the Indian
language, it was entitled <i>Wehkomaonganoo Asquam
Peantogig</i>, and was the painstaking work of that
picturesque early missionary, Apostle John Eliot,
who a few years before had translated the Bible for
the Indians’ use too. The auction price of this book—Baxter’s
<i>Call to the Unconverted</i>—was quick to
take hold of the public imagination; of course it was
colorful news, and English editors made the most
of it.</p>

<p>The story was cabled over here, and one afternoon
soon after my return a man telephoned saying he
had a book he must show me. His voice was shaking
with excitement, so I could not refuse him. He soon
called, a dignified elderly gentleman. Under his
arm he held tightly an old book.</p>

<p>“What is this?” he demanded as he proudly waved
the volume before my eyes. I glanced at it and answered,
“It looks very much like a Baxter’s <i>Call to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</span>
the Unconverted</i>.” I had hardly spoken when he gave
a short gasp and pulled a newspaper clipping from
his pocket. As I read, I understood this poor fellow’s
hopes; he believed he had made a great find. The
most significant fact about my purchase was not
mentioned in the clipping. Its great value lay in
that it was the only known copy of Eliot’s translation
of Baxter’s work into the Indian language. When
I told him this, and that editions in English were as
common as blackberries, he suddenly grew pale and,
as he turned away in disappointment, said in a dejected
tone, “I feel $34,000 poorer than when I
came in!”</p>

<p>It is extremely unfortunate that the price of first
editions should occupy so predominant a place in the
public mind. The true book lover gives the question
of monetary value the last as well as the least important
place in his passion for collecting. If the
average reader finds it easier to remember books by
their prices in lieu of other earmarks, he can look
forward to a time in the near future when he must
revalue his entire mental collection. Prices of fine
books are rising to new heights. Old records show
they have advanced continually since the middle of
the seventeenth century. Prices are now bound to
go much higher. The world is filled with books, but
the number of desirable ones is limited.</p>

<p>During the past decade many wonderful rarities
have been taken off the market forever. They have
found a final resting place in public institutions.
Two of the greatest private collections in this country,
those of Mr. Henry E. Huntington and the late
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</span>Pierpont Morgan, have been dedicated forever to
the people. These splendid gifts comprise, at a very
rough estimate, more than one hundred thousand of
the world’s choicest literary treasures. Mr. William
L. Clements, of Bay City, Michigan, has donated
his library of Americana to the University of Michigan,
and Mr. William A. Clark, Jr., of Los Angeles,
his splendid collection to the southern branch of the
University of California, thus removing all possibility
of their books ever being offered for sale. Mr.
Clark is held in grateful esteem by scholars and
lovers of books for his superb series of facsimiles of
great English classics in his collection.</p>

<p>The magnificent gift of the library of Harry Elkins
Widener to Harvard University is another case in
point. Born in Philadelphia, Harry Elkins Widener
spent his childhood on the large estate of his grandfather,
the late P. A. B. Widener, in a home filled with
treasures brought together from all parts of the world.
The collector’s spirit was his through both inheritance
and environment. When a young boy he showed an
interest in books, and as he grew older proved himself
a born student of bibliography. Books were his
life work, his recreation, his passion.</p>

<p>I think if Harry Elkins Widener had lived he would
have been the greatest collector the world has ever
known. Of course he began as all collectors do,
gathering rather unimportant works. But he weeded
them out sooner than most enthusiasts, and by the
time he was twenty-six had a library of three thousand
volumes; each one of these showed a most
fastidious, exacting, and exquisite taste, which he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</span>
had found possible to gratify through the sympathy
and generosity of his grandfather and his mother.
When abroad attending various book sales, because
of his youth and remarkable learning he attracted
the attention of many older collectors. After the
Huth sale in 1912 in London, he slipped a volume of
Bacon’s <i>Essays</i> in his pocket—a second edition
which is almost as rare as a first—and, turning to
a friend, said, “I think I’ll take that little Bacon
with me in my pocket, and if I am shipwrecked it will
go down with me.” With what prophecy he spoke
they little knew. A few days later he was one of the
victims of the Titanic disaster. His books may be
enjoyed by students forever, but they will never
again be offered for sale.</p>

<p>To-day there are twice as many people collecting
books in this country as there were five years ago.
Every year they increase in numbers, and the competition
is keener for the best things. Naturally,
prices must go up. The much-maligned business man
who collects books will at last come into his own.
He has been held for many years responsible for
musical-comedy successes, but nothing is said of his
books and his collecting. It is restful to think of him
in his library of an evening instead of in the first row
of a crowded theatre.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="f11">
<img src="images/fig11.jpg" alt="newton">
<p class="caption">A. EDWARD NEWTON</p>
</div>

<p>The increasing number of scholars in this country,
with their insistent demands for the original sources
of history and literature, is another cause for advancing
prices. After all, contemporary documents
are the only authentic tools for the student. The
collector renders a real service to scholarship when
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</span>he uncovers valuable unpublished material. A dear
friend of mine has been also largely responsible for
the modern esteem of old authors. A. Edward Newton,
through his popular and appealing books about
books, has inspired many to collect them. His
<i>Amenities of Book Collecting</i> is the bibliophile’s Bible;
and his unbounded enthusiasm for Doctor Johnson
is so intense that it is now contagious. Everyone
has become infected with it. A new Johnsonian interest
has spread over the country, and a first edition
of Boswell’s <i>Life of Johnson</i>, published in London in
1791, which used to sell for seventy-five dollars, now
brings $450, and in its original covers twice this
price.</p>

<p>Certain books have sold for too little in the past.
They remind me of people who plod along for
years, then, through actual worth or a turn of the
wheel, suddenly blossom out, much to their friends’
astonishment. As material as it may sound, the increasing
wealth in this country is bringing about a
new appreciation not only of books but of old prints,
paintings, and antique furniture. Books are the
final appeal; when the collector is through with the
things that decorate his house, he turns to the things
that decorate his mind—and these last forever.</p>

</div>

<p>The formation of university libraries and historical
societies also adds to the value of books. They take
them out of reach of the individual collector and
place them in their ultimate home. No wonder these
libraries are considered tombs by the ardent gatherer
of books. New seats of learning, such as Duke University
at Durham, North Carolina, will certainly
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</span>need adequate libraries. Book clubs, too, are adding
fuel to the flames. The Grolier Club of New York
has a fine library; the Elizabethan Club at Yale is
the enviable possessor of a tiny volume that ranks
among the great books of the world. It is a first
edition of Bacon’s <i>Essays</i>, printed in London in 1597.
Fifteen years ago, at the Huth sale, it brought £1950—more
than $9000. If it were offered for sale to-day
it would bring at least $25,000. There are only
about five copies of this edition known. One is in
the British Museum, Cambridge University has two,
and a fourth is in the Huntington Library. Thus, no
private collector has the good fortune to own a single
copy.</p>

<p>Even though many rare volumes have retired permanently
from the salesrooms, it has always been a
peculiarity of the collector that he lives in hope.
Just as there has always been a great search for ancient
manuscripts, so there always will be an endless
hunt for important early books. If there were wonderful
discoveries in the past, why not others of equal
importance in the future? Within twenty years
after the invention of printing—about 1475—books
became so accessible that even the poorest
scholars could afford them. Tracts of various kinds
were marketed for a few pennies which at first had
sold for pounds. There was so much printing done that
some printers were ruined because the supply quickly
outgrew the demand. The best printers in Germany
perfected their craft and went southward into Italy,
where their work took on an added beauty. The city
of Venice became a regular hotbed of printing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</span></p>

<p>When, in the latter part of the fifteenth century,
Italian noblemen saw how common printing had become,
they regarded it as vulgar. Although they had
at first been the patrons of printing, now some of
them ignored it and endowed scriptoriums, in the
hope that printing would fall into disfavor. In these
scriptoriums men worked tediously on illuminated
manuscripts, trying to make them finer than printed
books. But of course printing went on, continuing
its tremendous strides. Hope springs eternal in the
book collector’s breast. He will never allow himself
to believe that the wonderful old volumes of hundreds
of years ago have all been found. To-day, to-morrow,
or next week, he must surely unearth some
unrecorded book.</p>

<p>What is known among book lovers as the greatest
little find in history occurred at Lamport Hall in
Northamptonshire, England, in 1867. Charles Edmunds,
a London bookseller, while visiting Lamport
Hall, the ancient seat of the Isham family, accidentally
came upon the old lumber room. His curiosity
was immediately aroused, for among the piles of wood
and discarded furniture he beheld stacks and stacks
of dust-covered books. There were hundreds of them
of various sizes and dates; some were chewed to bits,
having furnished banquets for generations of mice,
descendants of which scampered about as Edmunds
searched and hoped for something interesting. Just
as he was beginning to believe that they all were
valueless, he chanced upon a copy of Shakespeare’s
<i>Venus and Adonis</i>. Imagine his surprise when he
found it to be a hitherto unknown edition dated 1599,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</span>
and “Imprinted at London for William Leake, dwelling
in Paule’s Churchyard at the signe of the Greyhound.”
Inclosed within the same vellum cover
were <i>The Passionate Pilgrim</i> and Davies’s and Marlowe’s
<i>Epigrams and Elegies</i>. The only other copy
known of the former is in the Capell collection at
Trinity College, Cambridge. The third tract in this
volume was also an entirely unrecorded edition.</p>

<p>This <i>Venus and Adonis</i> was a fourth edition. It
sold at the Britwell Court sale at Sotheby’s, in 1919,
for £15,100—about $75,000. George D. Smith
bought it for Mr. Huntington, and it was the highest
price ever paid for a book up to that time. Whenever
a great sale such as this one is held, prices reverberate
throughout the world. Immediately there
follows a cleaning out of old attics, a thorough brushing
of odd closets; cupboards and lumber rooms are
scoured; and a general sorting over of places where
odd things have been relegated for years takes place.
Naturally, the enormous price of the <i>Venus and
Adonis</i> caused a sensation when it was sold in London.
News of this sale quickly appeared in every
paper in England.</p>

<p>A pretty story is told of how, one afternoon, two
young Englishmen were playing archery on an estate
near Shrewsbury. Perhaps they didn’t have a target,
or if they did they mislaid it. Anyway, they picked
up an old book they found somewhere in one of the
buildings on the place, and stuck it against the lower
branches of a tree to use for a bull’s-eye. About to
draw his bow, one of them was not quite satisfied
with the angle at which they had placed their target.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</span>
So he walked forward and turned it around. As he
did so, some of the pages fell back, and he read the
magic name, “Venus.” Looking at the volume further,
he exclaimed to his companion, “I believe this
old thing is similar to that book which sold for
£15,100 yesterday!” It soon sold privately for more
than £10,000, or about $50,000. Mr. H. C. Folger
of New York, the greatest collector of Shakespeareana,
was the buyer.</p>

<p>With these stories indelibly impressed on my mind,
my delight was unbounded when I espied on the
library shelves of Dorchester House, London, the
residence of Sir George Holford, a matchless copy of
<i>Venus</i> in the second edition, 1594, five years earlier
than these famous “fourths.” Only three other
copies were known. Be assured that this was one of
the first volumes I selected when, the following year,
I purchased the greater part of his collection. From
a monetary point of view this is the most valuable
book that has ever been sold.</p>

<p>To bring these stories down to date, an almost
equally interesting find was made after the sale of a
signature of Button Gwinnett, at the Anderson Galleries
in New York last winter, for which I paid
$22,500. Gwinnett was one of the signers of the
Declaration of Independence from Georgia. His
signature is very rare, as his life was snuffed out
suddenly in a duel with General Lachlan MacIntosh
in 1777, when he was still young. There are but thirty-three
of these signatures known. I bought my first
Gwinnett, incidentally the first to be sold in many
years, in Philadelphia two years ago for $14,000.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</span>
Some wag figured, at the time, that it was worth
exactly $1000 per letter. Mrs. Arthur W. Swann, of
New York, happened to read about my purchase in a
morning paper, and began to think over the various
items of a collection of autograph letters which her
grandfather, Theodore Sedgwick, had made, and
which she inherited. The more she thought about it,
the more significant a hazy remembrance became;
she believed her grandfather had secured a Button
Gwinnett similar to the one I bought. After carefully
searching through the collection she found, much to
her surprise and delight, a most beautiful example of
Gwinnett’s signature. In November, 1926, she sold
the entire collection, and I bought the Button Gwinnett
for $28,500. This was then a record price for any
signature in the world’s history, the young signer’s
autograph having jumped to $2000 per letter! After
a while, selling a famous man’s handwriting by the
letter will be as common as selling antique silver by
the ounce.</p>

<p>About four years ago a firm of auctioneers in London
was requested to sell a great mass of ordinary
music belonging to the estate of a late English noblewoman.
The manager and his assistants were not
very keen about it, as the music was unsorted and
on its face almost worthless. But they finally agreed
to do it on the condition it should not require sorting.
During the sale a dealer bought one of the bundles.
Later he sold some of it to other dealers, saving
several sheets for himself to take home. Some time
passed and one night he chanced to glance over the
titles of these songs, catches, and other musical compositions.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</span>
As he turned one of the pages he fairly
started from his seat. He could hardly believe his
eyes. A quarto pamphlet it was, and most probably
had been placed there years and years before—perhaps
as a bookmark—by someone who did not
realize its worth. It was a copy of <i>Posthumous Fragments
of Margaret Nicholson</i> by Shelley! The author’s
name was not mentioned, but it was edited by
“Fitzvictor,” one of Shelley’s pen names. Here it
lay before him, in the original wrappers in which it
was first published. Of course, the news of the discovery
spread like wildfire. Later, this work sold
for £1210, approximately $6000.</p>

<p>Propagandist pamphlets written by Shelley are
extremely rare, and have turned up in the most extraordinary
places. They were generally of an inflammatory
or seditious nature, and he and Harriet
had the habit of throwing them from the windows
wherever they might be staying at the time, in the
hope of hitting sympathetic targets. I should like to
be struck by one of those missiles!</p>

<p>Shortly after the War began I was informed of a
letter written by Amerigo Vespucci, to be offered in
the Morrison sale in London. It was the only known
letter written by the man who gave his name to two
continents. Previous to its finding, the only record
of Vespucci’s own writing was a receipt bearing his
signature. Now, the early stages of the Great War
were not exactly propitious times for auctions or any
other sales. The buying public of England, as well
as auctioneers, dealers, and collectors, all found their
minds preoccupied with but one subject—war.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</span>
<i>Objets d’art</i>, books, and manuscripts were put aside
as playthings of a leisured hour; nor were they to
be considered when relatives and friends were fast
becoming a part of the war machinery daily departing
for France. So prices did the logical thing—tumbled.</p>

<p>Although I was aware of the situation, I believed
it impossible that this Vespucci letter could go for
a low figure. Here was an unusual, magnificent
autograph more than four centuries old. War?
Why, it had known a hundred wars! With little hope
and less expectation, I cabled a bid of £2500—about
$12,500. The arrival of a reply a few hours later
caused me pangs of fear. I tortured myself a few
moments with delectable suspense. Was the letter
mine or not? A momentous question! At last I
gathered courage and read words which were too
curt, too few, to seem true. Not only was I the
possessor of this most precious historical letter, but
at what a price—a measly £395! It was almost
impossible to realize that I had secured for less than
$2000 one of the greatest bargains in history.</p>

</div>

<p>I was under a constant nervous tension until its
arrival. When it finally came I went with it into my
library, locked the door, and settled down to decipher
the old and decorative handwriting. Vespucci had
written in Latin a somewhat grave and formal filial
epistle to his father. He was in Trivio Mugelli at the
time, October 18, 1476. He comments on a commonplace
book, belonging to his uncle, Giorgio
Antonio Vespucci. These commonplace books were
frequently kept in the fifteenth century. They were
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</span>used to note down Greek and Latin quotations, the
common information of the period. I had hardly
finished reading this before some mental click went off
in my mind. I left my comfortable chair and walked
suddenly to a corner of my bookcase. Quickly I
picked out an old manuscript in a fifteenth-century
binding. I held in my hands an ancient commonplace
book. There on the title page was the written name—Giorgio
Antonio Vespucci!</p>

<p>Side by side in my library were Amerigo’s only
letter and Uncle Giorgio’s commonplace book! I was
thrilled by it all. In something of a daze I placed the
two on the table before me. Separated for nearly five
hundred years, they were again together. Where had
they been those five centuries? What had they seen
and heard? If someone had thrown a diamond into
the middle of the ocean, to recover it years later, it
could not have been a greater miracle than this
almost impossible literary remating. Now the letter
and the volume are in the Pierpont Morgan library,
united forever.</p>

<p>Some collectors, to my eternal amazement, are
completely satisfied with small libraries. This desire
for a limited number of exquisite books originated
in France centuries ago. Many of the wealthiest and
most meticulous book lovers went in for what is
known as cabinet collecting. They liked small books
which they could handle easily, and found no interest
in the first edition of even an important classic
if it were large. Diane de Poitiers was one of the
first cabinet collectors. The beloved of Henry II,
she would doubtless be forgotten by collectors to-day<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</span>
if she had not, like Cardinal Wolsey, loved her books
more than her king. When she became a widow,
Diane immediately stamped her volumes with a
laurel springing from a tomb, with the motto, “I
live alone in grief.” But when she began her friendship
with Henry she suppressed both the tomb and
the legend.</p>

<p>In her boudoir in the Château d’Anet, just outside
of Paris, long after her death a small case was found
filled with the most precious volumes, all in beautiful
bindings of red and citron morocco, decorated
with the crescents of Diana the book huntress. This
little nest of bookish nuggets was not found until
1723, but was in perfect condition. The diversity of
its contents was amusing. The fathers of the Church
nestled close to some of the most risqué stories of
that time, and the poets stood side by side with
treatises on medicine and the management of the
household. It has always been of interest to me that
in the small collection of Diane de Poitiers were two
books relating to this country, thus making her one
of the earliest collectors of Americana. The first
was Servete’s edition of Ptolemy’s <i>Geography</i>, dated
1541, and the other, <i>Les Singularitez de la France
Antartique autrement nommée Amerique</i>, brought out
seventeen years later.</p>

<p>Perhaps the man who makes a covenant with himself
to buy only a small number of books, imitating
the French collectors, is the happiest and wisest of
us all. He knows in his mind the location of every
volume on his shelves. At least he runs little chance
of finding himself in the position which was forced<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</span>
upon me several years ago. I had purchased a first
edition of Defoe’s <i>Robinson Crusoe</i>, published in 1719,
for which I paid $2500. Along with thousands of
other volumes on my shelves, I had not thought for
months of poor old Crusoe and his man Friday.</p>

<p>One day, however, a stranger came to see me, announcing
with a great air of assurance he had a really
fine book which he knew would delight me. Just how
much, neither of us realized until it was removed from
its brown-paper wrapping. Then I recognized the
binding, and that it was my own <i>Robinson Crusoe</i>!
I concealed my surprise as I asked for its history and
how he had come by it. With charming facility he
explained that it was left by his father-in-law to his
wife, and I became furious when he wound up with
the worn tale of its having been in his family “for
over one hundred years.”</p>

<p>After he had finished his finely embroidered story
I excused myself from the room for a moment to telephone
police headquarters. Returning, I directly
accused him of having acquired the book dishonestly.
Looking me in the eye, more in sorrow than in anger,
he stood by his guns. But when he heard the echo
of heavy footsteps beyond my study door he broke
down, and told me a sordid hard-luck story which
made me feel rather sorry for him. I learned then
that he had also bought other volumes from a man
who had been employed by me some months before.
He paid a few dollars for each book—I asked him
for the names of the others, and was relieved that they
did not compare in value to the <i>Robinson Crusoe</i>—and
they were delivered to his junk shop. There was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</span>
some wistful quality about this fellow; aside from
his dishonesty, he spoke of books as though he loved
them. I could not prosecute him. Again I left the
room, this time to tell the two detectives who were
waiting that I would not press the charge. And it
did seem most unfortunate for him that he came to
me, of all people in the world, with that <i>Robinson
Crusoe</i>!</p>

<p>The modern book lover who gratifies his taste with
a small collection usually starts off with what he calls
a logical reason for his fixed policy. Some men
will collect everything they can find which has been
written by or associated with an author they love,
generally some writer who has had a definite influence
upon their lives. Thus there are men who
gather every edition, pamphlet, manuscript, autograph,
or personal relic of Burns, Shelley, Thackeray,
or Dickens, to mention only a few. Other sentimentalists
must have every line of verse by the poet
whose rhythmic genius has struck sparks of music
or passion in their own souls. On the other hand, a
practical person, such as an Arctic explorer, will
hunt out every known document mentioning the
Arctic, while his colleague, the African explorer, follows
suit with his desires for all works concerning
his favorite quarter of the globe.</p>

<p>For years I have had a charming customer who is
a romanticist if ever there was one. Her enthusiasm
is for books on those idealistic lands beyond the
mountains or behind the moon about which English
writers of all centuries have delighted to weave
strange fantastic tales, such as Sir Thomas More’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</span>
<i>Utopia</i> and Sir Philip Sidney’s <i>Arcadia</i>. Then there
is another customer, with his vivid remembrance of
old vintages, whose standing order since the passing
of the Volstead Act has kept us busy gathering all
editions and early works mentioning ardent spirits.
He smacks his lips with gusto when he obtains a particularly
rare one. Another great amateur’s favorite
subject is everything relating to tobacco. English
authors from Ben Jonson to Charles Lamb allowed
their love of tobacco to permeate their works, and
it is therefore a delightful task, especially to an
inveterate smoker, to pick up, here and there, old
books in which the authors endearingly mention
perique and “cigars of the Havana.” I recently
owned a rare little volume on which Charles Lamb
had spilled some ale, and in which were found remnants
of tobacco. This might have caused a battle
royal between the two friends above mentioned, and,
as I could not divide the volume, I, like King Solomon
on a more famous occasion, sold it to a collector
who was interested in gentle Elia for his dear self alone.</p>

<p>Very often these specialists have a change of
heart. Their tastes broaden and they develop into
the maddest collectors of all. Perhaps they suddenly
realize the limited span of even a collector’s life,
and find they are missing many enchanting bypaths
along the highroad of books. When Richard Heber,
the greatest bibliomaniac who ever lived, began his
library, he was interested only in purely classical
works. This English gentleman, although he has
been dead for nearly one hundred years, still survives,
enshrined in every true bookman’s heart. To<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</span>
recognize in oneself the symptoms of becoming
“the fiercest and strongest of all bibliomaniacs”—so
Heber is described—what secret joy and satisfaction!
Heber’s library grew to enormous proportions,
and when he died he left more than one hundred and
fifty thousand volumes. Like Earl Spencer, it was
necessary for him to have many houses, just to hold
his books. Eight establishments there were, on the
Continent and in England, each overrun with books.
It was he who started the craze for duplicate copies,
explaining that no one could afford to be without
three copies of a book: one for show, the second
for use, and the third for borrowers!</p>

<p>Everybody knows it is never quite safe to lend an
umbrella, even to one’s dearest friend; the very act
of lending seems to demoralize the borrower, who
thinks not of the rainy days to come. If there is
scant hope of ever seeing the umbrella again, how
much less is there for a borrowed book—unless it
happens to be a rare one! In that case it may be discovered
several generations later, when the worried
and loving owner, who by this time is reclining in
some bookish Nirvana, cares little for earthly treasures.
How many great literary finds have been made
as a result of careless borrowers, I wonder!</p>

<p>There is the case of a certain Englishman who,
several years ago, “borrowed” some early English
books, printed by Caxton and Wynkyn de Worde,
from the libraries of Lincoln and Peterborough
Cathedrals. Lest they should be missed immediately,
he left behind him the covers of the books,
stuffed with newspapers and replaced on the shelves;
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</span>the contents he carried away in his pockets. But
one day someone browsing about chanced to take
down these skeleton books. The fraud was discovered
and reported to all book dealers and collectors in
England, so they should be on the lookout. Some of
the volumes, minus bindings, have already turned
up at various sales, but where they all are no one
knows. They may be discovered again somewhere,
some day.</p>

<p>One day before the War a stranger called on
Quaritch, one of the most celebrated and astute
booksellers in London, to whose shop many rare
books, in those days, naturally drifted. This man
said he had an old book, but didn’t know its value.
Quaritch looked at it, and immediately recognized it
as the long-lost and valuable edition of the laws of
Massachusetts, known to collectors as <i>The General
Laws and Liberties of Massachusetts, collected out of
the Records of the General Courts</i>, and printed at
Cambridge, Massachusetts, in 1648. Inquiring of the
owner what he thought he should receive for it, the
man would not say; he desired Quaritch to make
him an offer.</p>

<p>Quaritch was known far and wide for his fair dealing.
Now he took into consideration various facts,
the most important of which was that he might have
to keep the volume for some years before reselling it.
He therefore offered what he felt to be a perfectly
fair price—£2500. The man looked at him in “wild
surmise,” then gasped. He would have accepted
fifty pounds for it! But now, he said, as he put on
his hat, with the layman’s suspicious look in his eye,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</span>
he would have to think it over. He was too frightened
to make up his mind just then. He never went
back to Quaritch, but shopped around a long time,
selling it eventually for £5000—a little less than
$25,000. Alfred Quaritch told me that it was this
experience which cured him forever of making offers
on books.</p>

<p>It is amazing how many of these first American
editions have been found across the Atlantic. Several
years ago, while in England, I was invited by a noted
collector to inspect his library. We had been talking
books for hours, and as the twilight approached, did
not think to turn on the lights. I got up to leave and
stumbled against a folio volume which someone had
carelessly left on the floor. I carried it quickly to the
window to see what it was. Opening the old calf
binding in the fading light, I read the written inscription
on the title page: “This book was used in
the Trial of the Earl of Bellomont, Governor of New
York.” It was, to my astonishment, my uncle Moses’
old <i>bête-noir</i>, the very rare <i>First Laws of New York</i>,
printed by William Bradford in 1694. I was extremely
pleased with this volume, and suggested to the owner
that inasmuch as it was a New York book, and not
particularly interesting to him, he might care to part
with it, which to my joy he gracefully did.</p>

<p>Printer Bradford has the distinction of being the
first in both Philadelphia and New York. His earlier
works, published in Philadelphia, loudly proclaim
the hatred he had for some of the Quakers of his day.
He was constantly bringing out tracts against them.
When they threatened to jail him he found it necessary<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</span>
to leave the City of Brotherly Love, and settled
in New York. Several years ago I attended a sale in
Philadelphia and came across a book which no one
seemed to know anything about. I showed it to
several other collectors, who pushed it aside, believing
it worthless, merely an old book. The name
of the printer or the place was not upon the title
page; I recognized it, however, as coming from
Bradford’s famous press.</p>

<p>It was a scurrilous attack on one Samuel Jennings,
Quaker, printed by Bradford in New York in 1693.
Entirely composed in rhyme, by John Philley, it was
lengthily titled: <i>A Paraphrastical Exposition in a
Letter from a Gentleman in Philadelphia to his Friend
in Boston concerning a certain Person who compared
himself to Mordecai</i>. I could not remember ever having
seen an earlier-dated book published in New
York. Here, then, was a first, which was valuable
from three standpoints. It was the only copy known;
it was probably the first book printed in New York;
it was the earliest poetical production of the New
York press. I am having a reprint made, so that it
will be accessible to all students of history.</p>

<p>I am sometimes given credit for discoveries which
I am not in the least entitled to. There are many
old bookmen, true ferrets, who are always on the
lookout for unusual things. They often bring their
finds to me. In Paris there is a whole tribe of book
seekers who infest the quays along the Seine, where
quaint volumes are occasionally found. Collectors
do not often have the good fortune to find great
rarities there, but my friend Mitchell Kennerley has<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</span>
the distinction of making one of the greatest finds
in bookish history. Many years ago, while walking
on the left bank of the Seine, he picked up, for a few
sous, Champlain’s first book on the Indians of
Canada, entitled <i>Des Sauvages</i>, issued in Paris in
1603. He kept it in his box at the Lotos Club in New
York for more than two years. The whole matter
was forgotten until someone, accidentally mentioning
old books on the American Indians, recalled to
his attention the little volume resting so quietly in
its solitary nook. Mr. Kennerley put it into an auction
sale in 1907, and no one was more greatly surprised
and elated than he when it sold for $2900.</p>

<p>This leads me to remember one of the most colorful
incidents of my collecting career, an experience
brought about through the consideration of a fellow
bookman. It happened when I was in Boston, attending
the dedication of the Harry Elkins Widener
Memorial Library in 1914. I had arrived on an early
train, so I decided to spend several pleasant hours
on Park Street with my friend Charles Goodspeed.
As I entered his shop he came forward with the exclamation,
“I have a manuscript in which you will
be interested, I am sure!” He disappeared into the
back of his shop, and I waited, filled with curiosity.
After a few moments he returned and handed me a
small piece of paper. As I read it I could hardly
believe that this was the first draft of Benjamin
Franklin’s famous epitaph, which is so dear to every
lover of old books. At first I was suspicious that it
might be a clever forgery. But when Goodspeed explained
that it came from the old and noted Aspinwall<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</span>
collection, I needed no further assurance. It
was absolutely authentic, and eagerly I purchased it.</p>

<p>This was Franklin’s first attempt at writing his
epitaph, dated 1728, and differed slightly in the
wording from the fair copy which has been for many
years in the Library of Congress in Washington. I
brought it back to Philadelphia in great glee and
showed it to Eddie Newton. In an ill-starred moment
for him, and to his everlasting regret, he refused
it. This is the only time—with one exception, which
is another story—that I knew him to fall down.
This epitaph has found its resting place in the magnificent
Franklin collection of William S. Mason, of
Evanston, Illinois.</p>

<p>Nothing better reveals the great American, the
man whose sayings have helped the destinies of the
New World, than this faded sheet of paper, where
the master printer gives, in the parlance of his trade,
this noble colophon:—</p>

<p><span class="smcap large">The</span> gas lamps in Stan V. Henkels’s auction rooms
in Philadelphia were being extinguished. An exciting
sale of books had just ended, and I was left
a rather bitter young man. The purchaser of the one
book I had so eagerly hoped to secure was a thin,
wiry man, with a face of rare charm. He was not an
auction habitué, at least not at Henkels’s, or I should
have recognized him. One gets used to the same old
faces in an auction room. Earlier that evening I
had noticed him two rows ahead of me, a distinguished-looking
person; but once the auctioneer’s
hammer had struck, giving him the final decision on
his bid, I changed my opinion, and he now appeared
highly distasteful to me.</p>

<p>As I went to open the street door I passed him.
He stood showing the book to a group of other
buyers. I would have died rather than ask his permission
to look at that ancient missal, which I felt
he had deliberately taken from me. And what a
copy! As perfect as the day it came from the scriptorium
in Touraine nearly four hundred years ago.
More important still, it had belonged at one time
to the exquisite and altogether enchanting Gabrielle
d’Estrées. She may have treated her lovers negligently,
but to her books she gave the gentlest care.
If the truth were known, she had a more tender
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</span>regard for her books than for Henry IV. Perhaps
she abandoned him to find change and relaxation in
looking at the pictures in this volume. I was nineteen;
the ephemeral love affairs of great court
beauties catch the imagination at that age as they
never do in later years.</p>

<p>You see, I had been saving every penny I could
lay my hands on to buy this book. I had read about
it in the sale catalogue. It is not exactly clear to me
to-day why I so desperately wanted to own this
particular missal. Perhaps it was one of those waxing
obsessions which seize book lovers at all seasons
of the year. I remember it was a warm, languorous
spring. The night air was sweet. As I walked along
I asked myself many questions: What good had
come of my hoarding every cent to purchase it?
Wasn’t it unfair of wealthy men who attend auctions
never to give the poor student a chance? I
had gone to that sale with fifty-seven dollars in my
pocket. It was an enormous sum for me to invest
in one book, and I really doubted that anyone
would want this particular volume badly enough to
pay more than fifty dollars for it. Imagine my surprise
when this stranger overbid me by three dollars!</p>

<p>Depressed, I wandered for some time along the
ill-lighted street before I was aware of quick steps
behind me. It was my successful competitor. And
from another direction I saw a horse and cab drive
toward me. A dim street light revealed the blurred
outlines of a rickety worn-out nag whose driver
slouched above on the box. It was Wee-hicle.</p>

<p>Now Wee-hicle was a coachman of local renown.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</span>
His thin, emaciated, Don Quixotic figure had always
attracted my attention. Wee-hicle knew more individuals
of prominence in Philadelphia than did the
mayor himself. Further, Wee-hicle had vision. To
be carried home in the early hours by Wee-hicle
boded good. In this way he had sponsored the early
careers of more youths who later became distinguished
citizens than any Harvard professor. This
night he drove to the curb and recognized me. At
the same time the footsteps in the darkness quickened
and an anxious voice shouted, “Cabby!” Now
I wanted to go home with Wee-hicle myself. With a
rude bound, I reached the cab door before the person
behind me.</p>

<p>“Which way are you going?” he asked me as he
came close to the cab. His voice was clear and
friendly, nor was the dark too thick to hide the
kindliness of his expression. With that forced reciprocal
politeness which often overtakes one in the
heat of anger or disappointment, I battled with
a desire to grab the book and run off into the
darkness.</p>

<p>“I can take you anywhere you care to go,” I
answered. He heard the vindictive note in my voice,
as I meant him to. He looked at me uneasily.
Perhaps he feared I had been drinking.</p>

<p>“I feel like having a bite,” he began. “I’d like
to go to McGowan’s. Perhaps you will join me.”
Without waiting for a reply, he leaned forward and
called out our destination to Wee-hicle.</p>

<p>Those were the days when McGowan’s was an all-night
meeting place where convivial souls gathered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</span>
to eat, drink, and to be quietly merry. It was famous
for its terrapin; in fact, it was at that time
one of the great restaurants of America. Situated
at the corner of Fifteenth and Sansom streets, it had
an entrance on either side. When we arrived I told
Wee-hicle to wait.</p>

<p>After ordering supper my host picked up the
Gabrielle d’Estrées volume and exhibited it in a most
tantalizing manner.</p>

<p>“You paid a very high price for that little missal,”
I ventured.</p>

<p>He looked up, surprised. “How do you know?”</p>

<p>“I was there—at the auction.” At that moment
the waiter brought two long-stemmed glasses filled
with a golden-brown liquid. It was bitter and warming.
“I was the underbidder,” I said.</p>

<p>“You bid me up?” The waiter replaced our
glasses with others. We drank silently. “So you
wanted this book? Well, well! You love books?”
I nodded. His face seemed to soften. “And what
would you have given for it?” He handed the
volume across the table to me and my fingers trembled.</p>

<p>“All that I have in the world,” I said dramatically.
“Fifty-seven dollars.” The waiter came forward
with our supper. It was a beautiful repast worthy
of the skill of Dennis McGowan himself.</p>

<p>As we ate I listened to my new friend through an
ever-thickening haze. He told me of his interest in
books and manuscripts. He was not a collector
exactly, he explained, but a man who bought intermittently
as the desire came upon him.</p>

<p>“And now,” said he, “since you wanted this book
so badly, will you accept it as a proof of our newly
made friendship?” He leaned across the table and
I grasped his hand. He insisted upon my accepting
the volume as a gift! Then we talked of books and
bookmen until far into the night. We walked home
in the early morning air.</p>

<p>The next day at noon, as I crossed the campus of
the University of Pennsylvania, I was aware of a
familiar figure who waved and attracted great attention
with a coach whip. It was Wee-hicle.</p>

<p>“Say, young Rosenbach,” he holloed, “what do
you mean, keepin’ me waitin’ all night on Sansom
Street?” He came toward me on a run, accusingly.
“Sneakin’ out on Fifteenth Street, you and your
friend! I want my money! I waited outside all
night long. Twenty-five dollars, night rates!” To
quiet his shouting, I motioned him to follow me to
my room. I had forgotten him completely. Had the
preceding night been a dream or a nightmare?
Surely it was neither, for there on my bookshelf was
the missal in its old gilt binding—the book which
had been forced so generously upon me. I paid
Wee-hicle gladly and figured his services cheap at
the price. As to the gentleman who presented me
with the volume, it was Joseph M. Fox. He later
became my partner in the book business.</p>

<p>The auction business is an old, old game. Herodotus,
somewhere in his writings, describes the auctions
which took place once a year in all Babylonian
villages. In those days, before the advent of the
bachelor girl, despairing parents hopefully offered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</span>
their surplus maidens in the auction mart, where
they disposed of them in marriage to the highest
bidders. Then there were the auctions which followed
military victories. The Romans solved the
problem of dividing captives and other spoils of
war in this popular manner.</p>

<p>But the first book auctions, as far as records show,
began in the latter part of the seventeenth century
in Holland. The enterprising Dutchman who originated
the idea of selling literary works by competitive
bid, whether he was a book lover or interested only
in cold commercial hope of gain, should have his
memory appreciatively marked by periods of celebration
down the years. Can’t you imagine every true
book lover bowing to the name of this fellow who
brought a new and sharp-edged enjoyment into the
book game?</p>

<p>Of all the branches of the sport connected with
book collecting, that of attending book auctions is
the greatest, the most stirring. I presume some
patient mathematician knows the number of facets
of the Koh-i-nur diamond, but no one will ever be
able to count the emotional reflections which take
place during a book auction in the hearts and minds
of men and women who are enamored of books.
The book auction is an adventure. Other adventures
may lose their glamour if you repeat them, but each
experience at a sale of books brings a delightful
thrill never to be duplicated.</p>

<p>Other experiences in your life may have been
exciting, and you will always shrink from repeating
them, in the fear, perhaps, that they may lose some<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</span>
one quality. But the book auction, which includes
the sale of literary manuscripts and letters, continues
to offer those very elements which first fascinated
you. Don’t be surprised when you find
yourself one of the habitual adventurers. Unsympathetic,
misunderstanding friends may accuse you
of being a book-auction fiend, but you will listen
indulgently and let it go at that.</p>

<p>Most of the great books of the world have found
their way to the auction room at one time or another.
Bibliophiles of renown have sat restlessly out front
bidding against one another. It is these, rare books
and the buyers of them, who have given to the auction
its illustrious background. Nearly every collector
enters the auction field to enjoy its seductive
pleasures some time during the period of his fever.</p>

<p>When you first go to an auction you firmly believe
that prices are at their highest. The complaint of
high prices is as old as the auction game itself. The
morning after every sale you read the same old story
in your newspaper, of the “crazy,” “mad,” and
“exorbitant” prices which were paid. Present prices
always seem high. If you keep a record of them you
will find, in ten years’ time, that these prices are
extremely low. As a matter of fact, prices will never
be lower than they are to-day. Certain items may
fluctuate, but in general the great classics of all
literature can be revalued upward every ten years.
Very often you may have the feeling that you paid
too much for some book—in other words, you were
stung; and it may be so. But the beauty of it all
is that an auction holds fair play for all sides. Even
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</span>the experienced buyer is liable to get stung. You
are in good company. And joy of joys, the auctioneer,
your arch enemy, sometimes gets charmingly
stung himself! For who can say when some bargain
will drop unexpectedly into the collector’s maw?</p>

<p class="caption">BOOK AUCTION AT THE ANDERSON GALLERIES, NEW YORK, WITH DR. ROSENBACH ATTENDING</p>
</div>

<p>I remember a case in point. It was during the
third part of the Hoe sale in April 1912. In the
catalogue a celebrated autograph play by Lope de
Vega was listed. Entitled <i>Carlos V</i>, it had been
written in Toledo and was dated November 20, 1604.
Now manuscript plays by this famous Spanish writer
are extremely desirable. Although the greatest book
dealers and collectors of England, France, Italy, and
Germany were present that night, they either
slighted or forgot its value. I purchased it on my
first bid, $125.</p>

<p>A collector in Philadelphia had given me a bid of
$7500 on it! He was even then sitting at his telephone
impatiently waiting to hear if I had secured it
for him. The above story is at the expense of a New
York house. My next will be on a British concern,
in order to balance honors.</p>

<p>At the sale of the Britwell Court Library in London
in 1923, I noticed a little book lying sandwiched
between Paice’s <i>Fortune’s Lottery, or How a Ship of
Bristoll Called the Angel Gabriel Fought Against the
Spanish</i>, and Pallinganius’s <i>The Zodyacke of Lyfe</i>.
It was Philip Paine’s <i>Dailey Meditations, or Quotidian
Preparations for and Consideration of Death and
Eternity</i>, printed at Cambridge by Marmaduke
Johnson in 1668. As it was passed around the room
all my bookman friends looked at it and shook their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</span>
heads. Of value, they thought, comparatively
slight. Only a dull theological work. As I reread
the lengthy title something back in my brain made
me concentrate more carefully upon it. Somewhere
those printed words struck a vaguely familiar chord
in my memory. All during the sale I kept turning
forward to that page in my catalogue where it was
listed. Suddenly I knew! Marmaduke Johnson it
was who printed in Cambridge, Massachusetts, the
first Holy Scriptures issued for the North American
Indians—the Eliot Indian Bible.</p>

<p>The little book was put up for sale and I asked
leave to examine it again for a moment before
bidding. I knew at once it was printed in Cambridge,
Massachusetts, and not England. This made it
tremendously rare, because it was the only known
copy, hitherto unrecognized, of the first volume of
verse printed in North America. Those present
took it for granted from the catalogue description
that the little work was printed in Cambridge,
England, and as such, was certainly worth less than
the price at which it was soon knocked down to
me, fifty-one pounds. After the sale several people,
including a great Americana expert and the auctioneer,
met me and rather twitted me for paying $250
for a stupid old religious tract worth but a few shillings.
They were amazed that I had shown such a
lapse of judgment.</p>

<p>When I informed them what the book really was,
the auctioneer sadly asked, “Doctor, what would
you really have given for it?”</p>

<p>When I said £8000 or £9000—between $40,000<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</span>
and $50,000—he was not any too happy. During
the following year, when the little tract by Baxter in
the Indian dialect appeared for sale, they catalogued
it Cambridge, Massachusetts! Thus listed, it sold for
$34,000, as I have mentioned before.</p>

<p>You see, we are always reading of record prices
and it is very rare to hear of the valuable things that
slip through unobserved. It is these latter that give
book auctions their zest. And the auction houses, if
they only knew it, benefit also by the chance bargain,
for it is this very thing that attracts the public.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the most experienced buyer
never knows when he will have to pay a really high
price. It is the average, after all, that counts. Yet
here is a phenomenon which has always seemed
peculiar to me. When times are bad and prices in
Wall Street are tumbling, when Steel sells far below
its worth and the oils go begging, rare volumes continue
to command an ever-increasing price. In 1907,
the year of the panic, books sold for record sums at
auctions, while so-called standard securities dipped
sharply in a helpless market. Two years later, when
national finances were again wobbly, when the bears
were having a picnic with the lambs, old books
went for higher prices than ever before.</p>

<p>In the Henry W. Poor sale, held in New York
in this same year, record prices were established,
despite the prediction of the wiseacres, who said
that prices must go down. It is for this reason that
some of the most discerning men in Wall Street purchase
rare books as an investment. I know many a
captain of industry who quietly hides away in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</span>
secrecy of his strong box rare little volumes, such as
Shakespeare quartos, small pamphlets by Shelley,
and even first editions of Joseph Conrad. These rich
men realize—and rightly, too—that such treasures
will always sell at a premium, even though the market
is tumbling and Wall Street is in a panic. Owners of
precious books always find they do not have to wait
for the chance buyer. Their volumes can be sent
to the auction mart at any time, where they will
realize, as a rule, their full value.</p>

<p>America has had two really great auctioneers:
Stan V. Henkels, of beloved memory, and the late
Thomas E. Kirby. The latter in many respects exerted
the greatest influence of any person in the
auction world of this country. He was the founder of
the American Art Association, and his opinions on
objects of art were accepted as gospel by the most
meticulous collectors, including the late P. A. B.
Widener, William A. Clark, and Henry C. Frick.
He was really brilliant on the block, and his remarks
were frequently the wittiest imaginable. I remember
as a youth going to his auctions and being fascinated
by his repartee and the rapidity with which he sold.</p>

<p>Stan V. Henkels was the only auctioneer who catalogued
every work himself and cried his own sales
too. His humor was irresistible, and the audience
would often break out in guffaws of laughter at his
many bright sallies.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="f19">
<img src="images/fig19.jpg" alt="kirby">
<p class="caption">THOMAS E. KIRBY ON THE ROSTRUM</p>
</div>

<p>In 1902 I attended a sale at Henkels’s where the
price of a certain volume caused the book world to
hum for months afterward. I was late, and entered
the room as the bidding began on a little book which
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</span>was placed in full view of the audience. I asked one
of the employés for its number in the catalogue and
found that it was <i>The Dying Words of Ockanickon, an
Indian King</i>, and was published in London in 1682.
It did not seem to be a volume of much importance.
I was acquainted somewhat with its history. The
highest price it had ever brought was $52.50, at the
Barlow sale in 1890. I leaned forward to whisper
to a friend in the row ahead of me and he said $200
would be an enormous price for it.</p>

<p>Suddenly the air seemed charged with electricity,
and I looked about to see who was bidding. On one
side of the room sat a man I knew, A. J. Bowden,
who represented George H. Richmond and Company,
of New York. On the other I saw Mr. Robert
Dodd, of Dodd, Mead and Company. Both were
experienced auction bidders, with the set expression
of the mouth and the feverish, alert look. I did not
know at the time that both had received instructions
to buy this particular work at any price. Each had
that most dangerous weapon of the auction game,
the unlimited bid.</p>

<p>From sixty dollars the price rapidly jumped. Stan
V. Henkels, colorful, suave, provocative, naïve, and
humorous, kept egging them on. Up and up the
price went, until it reached the $900 mark. Then a
murmur of consternation swept the room, followed
by a hush. Robert Dodd broke the silence with a
$100 raise. Bowden followed with another $100 and
Dodd added $100 more. When Bowden finally
shouted, “Thirteen hundred dollars,” Dodd smiled.</p>

<p>“Fourteen hundred,” he said sweetly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</span></p>

<p>Just at this moment poor old Bowden exhibited
his first sign of weakness. He stopped bidding in
hundreds and raised the bid twenty-five.</p>

<p>Dodd saw his chance and brought up his battalion
with a crash. Little <i>Ockanickon</i> was wrested from
Bowden at the freak price of $1450. When Richmond
read in the paper next morning the price at which he
had so nearly bought <i>Ockanickon</i>, he fell out of bed!</p>

<p>Speaking of freak prices, think of my surprise when
I went to an auction one day last year and saw with
amused amazement a little volume of book mysteries
I once wrote. I felt self-conscious, uncomfortable,
and pleased, all rolled into one, when the
bids on <i>The Unpublishable Memoirs</i> jumped up, and
it finally sold for sixteen dollars. The joke is that
this volume is still obtainable at its published price
of $2.50.</p>

<p>The enormous and ever increasing attendance at
auction sales in the established city auction rooms is
caused by the hope that sometime a real bargain will
come your way. This is the lure, the real bait. It
has an appeal all its own. But for the young enthusiast
it is often a costly and dangerous game. It is
wiser to begin your bidding under the guidance of an
experienced agent. There are several collectors and
owners of great private libraries in this country whose
names are entirely unknown in the auction room.
They may enter the salesroom incognito, to enjoy
watching their agent at battle with others, but they
are careful not to run any risks themselves through
careless, inexperienced bidding. One of the greatest
book collectors in the world, Mr. Henry E. Huntington,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</span>never bid. In all the years during which he was
buying he never entered the lists to joust for himself.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="f20">
<img src="images/fig20.jpg" alt="drawing">
<p class="caption">THE BIBLIO-FIENDS</p>
<p class="caption"><i>Drawing by Oliver Herford for Dr. Rosenbach’s “Unpublishable<br>
Memoirs”</i></p>
</div>

<p>In the forty years I have been bidding I have found
a new thrill in every sale. From my earliest years
at Henkels’s auctions to the most recent sales in
London, Paris, and New York, I have repeatedly
known a fine exhilaration. I sniff the air like an old
war horse at the smell of powder. How often have
I felt my pulses race, my temperature rise with the
rising bids! But as I grow older I find I have to fight
that deadliest of maladies—conservatism. This is
one thing in the world that the collector should pray
to be delivered from. Of course it is awfully difficult
to pay $500 to-day for a book that in your youth
you could have picked up for only twenty, or to buy
a book for $1000 which two years ago passed through
your fingers for one third as much.</p>

<p>The late George D. Smith, a spectacular figure
in the auction mart for more than twenty years, was
the only man I ever knew entirely immune from
conservatism. I can remember him at the Hoe sale in
1911-12. There he was constantly bidding against
the sharpest and most astute members of both the
European and the American book trade. How cool
and collected he was in the very midst of battle! The
comments of his competitors remained unnoticed by
him when he paid what were then considered extravagant
prices for books and manuscripts. And his
judgment was right. To-day these same items can’t
be bought for two or three times the sums he paid.
When he purchased, toward the end of the sale, a
Gutenberg Bible for $50,000, everyone said he had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</span>
gone quite mad. They did not realize that the same
remarks were made sixty-five years earlier, when, in
1847, James Lenox had given £500—about $2500—for
it. This copy is now in the New York Public
Library. In my opinion the Gutenberg Bible was
then worth every dollar of the $50,000 which G. D. S.
paid for it. Ten years from now it will be cheap at
$250,000.</p>

<p>There have been many notable auctions during
the past twenty years, but I shall never forget my
first one in England, in 1907. A dear friend of mine,
and a most intelligent collector of exquisite taste,
Mr. William C. Van Antwerp, of San Francisco, had
gathered together a small but delectable library,
which he decided to sell at Sotheby’s in March of
that year. I crossed on the Oceanic with Alfred
Quaritch, who occupied a commanding position in
the book world.</p>

<p>I was but one of the small fry, out of college only a
few years. Quaritch and I had been drawn to each
other by the magnet of books. On the way over we
talked of the sale, and I dwelt with especial emphasis
on the fine first folio of Shakespeare in Van’s collection.
In a way, I was sounding out Quaritch, for
I knew instinctively that it would be useless to bid
against this giant of the auction room if he wanted
the folio himself. I grew very nervous as we sat
in the smoking room one evening when we were
about five days out. I decided I had hemmed and
hawed long enough. Finally I worked up courage
to ask him to execute a bid for me on the folio.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="f21">
<img src="images/fig21.jpg" alt="sotheby's">
<p class="caption">SOTHEBY’S AUCTION ROOM IN LONDON</p>
</div>

<p>He seemed surprised, and did not answer for some
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</span>moments. Then he asked me, “How much do you
intend to bid? I warn you, if it’s too low I’ll buy
it myself.”</p>

<p>I answered weakly, “Five thousand pounds.”</p>

<p>He opened his eyes wide. “That <i>is</i> a bid,” he
said, “and I’ll get it for you.”</p>

<p>Then came the day of the auction in London. I
remember sitting next to Quaritch, witnessing the
battle of wits and bids at Sotheby’s. I was shaking
like the proverbial aspen leaf, to a degree that I have
never done since. The bidding on the folio opened at
£500. After what seemed an interminable length of
time, it was knocked down to Quaritch for £3600. I
was so completely overcome with joy that I had to
walk around the block for air and refreshment to buck
me up. This was a handsome copy, bound in morocco
by Bedford, a celebrated craftsman of the 70’s.</p>

<p>I recall, too, Harry Elkins Widener’s pleasure when
this folio passed finally into his possession. I think
of all the books of his fine collection, he valued this
one the most. Years later, when we paid £8600—a
little under $43,000—at the Baroness Burdett-Coutts’s
sale, the record price for a Shakespeare
folio, I received my brother Philip’s cable, advising
me of our luck, without a tremor.</p>

<p>Fifteen years had rolled by; much water had run
under the bridge. Poor Quaritch, my dearest friend
in the book business, had passed away, only forty-two
years old when he died. His death was a great
loss to the world of rare books.</p>

<p>The price of a first folio indicates the trend of
values in the English market, just as the Boucher<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</span>
Molière, 1734, shows the state of the French market,
while the Dante printed in Foligno, 1472, tells the
tale of the Italian market. These books are always
rising in value, and it is the rapidity of their change
in price that shows which way the wind is blowing.
To-day, when the condition of a book is everything
and collectors pay more attention to it than to anything
else, fine first folios of Shakespeare are judged
by these three points: First, the copy must have its
full number of leaves, each page perfect, without
facsimile. Second, the binding. It is, of course, more
desirable in the original binding, or, next, rebound
in the eighteenth century, or, lastly, in a good modern
binding. In years to come the original binding will
be the chief of all desiderata. Third, the folio must
be of adequate size, about thirteen by eight and a
quarter inches. A quarter of an inch one way or
another can spell tragedy to the fanatical collector.
If you are lucky enough to find a first folio having
all three of these qualities, the gods are with you.
I have been fortunate to procure such an one, the
celebrated copy from Sir George Holford’s library.
It is perfect in every detail. It is exceptional
in having the blank leaves, known in no other
copy; its original old calf binding is without a
single blemish.</p>

<p>This is the finest first folio known to exist. It
is the cornerstone of a collection of Shakespeare’s
works which I have been gathering for many years.
I remember the excitement when we exhibited in
our Philadelphia show window the four folios, each
in its original binding, the <i>Poems</i>, in a similar binding,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</span>and forty-one of the early quarto plays. The
passionate interest shown by the man in the street
indicated his never-flagging enthusiasm for anything
pertaining to the greatest writer the world has known.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="f22">
<img src="images/fig22.jpg" alt="shakespeare">
<p class="caption">SHAKESPEARE WINDOW AT 1320 WALNUT STREET, PHILADELPHIA</p>
</div>

<p>In 1905, Mr. Bernard Buchanan MacGeorge, of
Glasgow, sold four Shakespeare folios in their original
binding to Marsden J. Perry, of Providence,
Rhode Island. He doubtless believed he was using
his cunning Scotch wisdom to a high degree when
he steadfastly held out for £10,000. At this price he
figured he was doing himself a neat turn, because he
had paid only £1700 for them six years before. But
if he had been a bit cannier, a little more patient, he
would have received two or three times the sum Mr.
Perry paid him. When the balance of the MacGeorge
Library was offered for sale at Sotheby’s in July 1924,
all the bibliophiles in bookdom would have torn one
another to bits to get the Shakespeare folios at the
old price. But I was lucky enough to procure them
when I purchased <i>en bloc</i> the Perry Library, and to-day
they are in the library of Mr. Joseph Widener, at
Lynnewood Hall, near Philadelphia.</p>

<p>Thank goodness, they are at least near home,
where I can look at them to my heart’s content.</p>

<p>The history of the Shakespeare folios is an interesting
one. Shakespeare’s genius was so overwhelming
that even the least of the nitwits of his day
appreciated him. His greatest contemporaries were
the most eager to preserve his works. Immediately
after his death in 1616 steps were taken to issue a
complete edition of his plays. His manuscripts were
probably collected, but, alas, not saved, and scholars<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</span>
of the time, many of whom had known him well,
labored to procure a perfect text.</p>

<p>Three years passed. Then, in 1619, the English
public was surprised to see issued a single volume
containing nine plays. No one knows how many
copies composed this edition, but it is a strange
circumstance that but one copy is in existence to-day.
I once owned it, but it finally passed to Mr. H. C.
Folger, of New York, who added it to his remarkable
collection of Shakespeareana. This one surviving
copy is in its original binding. It has an index, too,
in the quaint old handwriting of its first owner,
Edward Gwynne, who proudly stamped his name
in gilt on the outside cover. Even though I should
not care to be dubbed a prophet in my own country,
I do not hesitate to say that this book would bring
at least $200,000 if it were sold on the block to-day.</p>

<p>This 1619 volume was but a makeshift, playing for
its sale upon the magic name of Shakespeare. John
Heminge and Henry Condell, both true and tried
friends of the great Bard, and fellow actors, mentioned
in his will, undertook to give the world a
complete and correct edition of his plays. William
Jaggard and his son Isaac were responsible for the
printing, a laborious task when you consider that
the volume consisted of one thousand double-column
pages. Thus, the great first folio was finally issued
in 1623, in a plain calf binding. It contained a portrait
of William Shakespeare, with a leaf of verses
on the opposite page by his famous contemporary,
Ben Jonson. These are among the finest lines ever
written concerning Shakespeare, and perhaps the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</span>
greatest from Jonson’s pen. The original price of the
first folio was five dollars a copy.</p>

<p>One pound in 1623! And yet in the years between
1700 and 1750 it had only advanced to ten, which
reminds me of a good story. In 1790 the copy belonging
to John Watson Reed was offered for sale. That
astute collector, the Duke of Roxburghe, wanted it
and commissioned an agent to buy it for him. The
bidding started at five pounds and rose to the enormous
sum of twenty guineas! Everyone was astounded.
The duke’s agent grew faint-hearted and
passed a slip of paper to him suggesting that His
Grace retire from the contest. The duke replied with
these memorable and appropriate words:—</p>


<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent2">Lay on, Macduff;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And damn’d be him that first cries, “Hold, enough!”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>


<p>The folio finally fell to the duke for thirty-five
pounds. How often, when I feel myself weakening
at a sale, do I think of the old duke’s quotation from
<i>Macbeth</i>. It should be the motto of every auction
bidder.</p>

<p>The Duke of Roxburghe’s library was sold at
Sotheby’s in 1812, and it included the first folio.
It brought an advance of almost three hundred per
cent, being purchased by the Duke of Devonshire
for £100. It can be seen now in the Henry E. Huntington
Library. The sale of this collection more
than one hundred and fifteen years ago provided
a sensation which is still talked about, and was
not equaled until the auction of the Gutenberg
Bible a year ago last February. As Thomas Frognall
Dibdin said, it reverberated around the world. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</span>
Valdarfer Boccaccio was the high light in the Roxburghe
sale. This notorious volume was the only
perfect copy of the first edition of the <i>Decameron</i>.
I have always thought that his flowery description
of the bidding which took place in that “grand æra
of Bibliomania,” as he was so pleased to term it,
applies exactly to the tactics used in the modern
auction room. Dibdin wrote as follows:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The room was crowded to excess; and a sudden darkness
which came across gave rather an additional interest
to the scene. At length the moment of sale arrived. Mr.
Evans prefaced the putting up of the article by an appropriate
oration, in which he expatiated upon its excessive
rarity, and concluded by informing the company of
the regret and even “anguish of heart” expressed by Mr.
Van Praet that such a treasure was not at that time to be
found in the imperial collection at Paris. However, it
should seem Bonaparte’s agent was present. Silence followed
the address of Mr. Evans. On his right hand, leaning
against the wall, stood Earl Spencer; a little lower
down, and standing at right angles with His Lordship,
appeared the Marquis of Blandford. The Duke, I believe,
was not then present; but my Lord Althorp stood a little
backward to the right of his father Earl Spencer. Such
was “the ground taken up” by the adverse hosts.</p>

<p>The honor of firing the first shot was due to a gentleman
of Shropshire, unused to this species of warfare, and
who seemed to recoil from the reverberation of the report
himself had made! “One hundred guineas,” he exclaimed.
Again a pause ensued; but anon the biddings rose rapidly
to 500 guineas. Hitherto, however, it was evident that
the firing was but masked and desultory. At length all
random shots ceased, and the champions before named
stood gallantly up to each other, resolving not to flinch
from a trial of their respective strengths.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“A thousand guineas” were bid by Earl Spencer—to
which the Marquis added “ten.” You might have heard
a pin drop. All eyes were turned, all breathing well nigh
stopped ... every sword was put home within its scabbard,
and not a piece of steel was seen to move or to
glitter save that which each of these champions brandished
in his valorous hand. See, see! They parry, they
lunge, they hit; yet their strength is undiminished, and no
thought of yielding is entertained by either.... “Two
thousand pounds are offered by the Marquis.” ...</p>

<p>Then it was that Earl Spencer, as a prudent general,
began to think of an useless effusion of blood and expenditure
of ammunition—seeing that his adversary was as
resolute and “fresh” as at the onset. For a quarter of a
minute he paused; when my Lord Althorp advanced one
step forward, as if to supply his father with another spear
for the purpose of renewing the contest. His countenance
was marked by a fixed determination to gain the prize—if
prudence, in its most commanding form, and with a
frown of unusual intensity of expression, had not bade
him desist. The father and son for a few seconds converse
apart; and the biddings are resumed.</p>

<p>“Two thousand two hundred and fifty pounds,” said
Lord Spencer. The spectators are now absolutely electrified.
The Marquis quietly adds his usual “ten” ... and
there is an <span class="allsmcap">END OF THE CONTEST</span>! Mr. Evans,
ere his hammer fell, made a due pause—and indeed, as
if by something præternatural, the ebony instrument
itself seemed to be charmed or suspended “in midair.”
However, at length down dropt the hammer ... and,
as Lisardo has not merely poetically expressed himself,
“the echo” of the sound of that fallen hammer “was
heard in the libraries of Rome, of Milan, and St. Mark.”</p>
</div>

<p>The name Dibdin has come to be almost synonymous
with “bibliomaniac.” Although Pennypacker,
twenty-five years ago, said that the true bibliomaniac<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</span>
was a rarissimo,—nearly as scarce as the dodo,—a
new generation of Dibdin men is springing up.
There are young men to-day who find it as difficult
to pass an old bookstore or a junk shop as did those
in years gone by; young fellows who will travel miles
to enrich their knowledge of books. I’m afraid it’s
the old-timer, though, who lives among his books,
sleeps among them, surrounded by folios, quartos,
books of every size, who thrives in an atmosphere
that is musty, who frowns upon cleanliness as a vice.
Of course, such peculiarities are hardly necessary or
desirable, but such men have lived. The modern
Dibdin takes a course in bibliography at college and
attends all book sales. He marks down prices, learns
the various methods experienced bidders use, thus
supplementing his college training with all that he
learns in the auction room.</p>

<p>Many years ago I knew a young married man who
lived in Orange. He was auction mad. One New
York sale we both attended continued for twelve
evenings. On the twelfth his bride appeared with
him and he introduced her to the other maniacs. In
those days it was quite unusual for a woman to
appear at a book auction.</p>

<p>“Why did you bring Mrs. Blank to-night?” I
inquired.</p>

<p>“Oh,” said he, “it came to the point where I just
had to prove there were such things as book auctions!”</p>

<p>Although the following tale has nothing to do with
book auctions, I am reminded of it because it has
distinctly to do with wives. And wives, there is no<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</span>
doubt about it, have their niche in the book world,
if only for the influence they have upon their book-mad
consorts.</p>

<p>A small man with a shy, walruslike look came to
see me one day in Philadelphia. His meek appearance
was in marked contrast to the determined
manner with which he greeted me. He introduced
himself as a piano tuner from Harrisburg.</p>

<p>“I have here, doctor,” he said, pulling out of an
inner pocket a blue envelope, “something which will
interest you. I found it in a secondhand-furniture
store among a bundle of papers on its way to the
pulp mill. I rescued it.” He opened the envelope
and drew out a pamphlet in brown paper wrappers.
It was Poe’s <i>Prose Romances. No. I. Containing
The Murders in the Rue Morgue</i>, published in Philadelphia
in 1843. There are only three or four copies
known to exist.</p>

<p>“What do you want for it?” I asked him.</p>

<p>“Three thousand eight hundred,” he said quite
calmly. Naturally I was surprised that a man who
made his living tinkering with refractory pianos
should know the value of this work. In answer to
further questions, he told me that he spent all his
evenings and some of his days browsing in secondhand
stores, in the hope of making a book find.</p>

<p>“And now my dream’s come true. I’m always
picking up old books. It makes my wife wild. She
always nags me. Wasting time and throwing away
good cash, she calls it!”</p>

<p>I had to have this book. While I wrote out the
check I asked him why he wanted this peculiar sum,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</span>and what he would do with it. He answered without
hesitation.</p>

<p>“The first thing I’ll do,” he said, “is to hand over
$800 of it to the missus and let her go to Europe,
like she’s always wanted to do. I told her I’d fix
her one day! I guess she won’t nag me any more!”</p>

<p>I recall the crowd present at the sale of the collection
of that great editor of Keats, J. Buxton Forman,
in 1920. Students, collectors, poets, seers, bookmen
were there. Suddenly the auctioneer announced that
the next item was a love letter of Keats to Fanny
Brawne. Whereupon my friend Kit Morley was
inspired and wrote this exquisite sonnet, which he
dedicated to me:—</p>

<p class="c large sp">SOME LITERARY FORGERIES</p>


<p>“<span class="smcap large">I cast</span> my bread upon the waters, and it came
back to me after many days!”</p>

<p>“What do you mean by that?” I asked the tall
white-haired man who sat opposite me in his luxurious
library. The room was an enormous one, and
thousands of fine books lined the walls from floor to
ceiling. My friend seemed in a confidential mood, and
I expected to hear something startling. This Gothic
room, with its early Spanish religious sculptures, had
the very atmosphere of a confessional. My companion
had had a somewhat weird career, and as I
watched him through the heavy smoke of our cigars
I recalled many strange stories of his youth. Once
he had been a lawyer’s clerk, but now he was a
director in many banks, with financial interests all
over the world. The variegated stages by which he
had risen to such eminence, not only in business but
as a collector of pictures and books, were not always
clear to the friends of his later years.</p>

<p>He told me that he had been so poor as a boy he
had often known hunger; that, as a scrivener in the
lawyer’s office, he had eked out a most pitiable
existence copying deeds and other legal documents.
In 1885 he happened to read in the newspapers of
famous auction sales of autographs in London, and
of the first arrival in this country of representatives<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</span>
of the English book houses. For instance, Bernard
Quaritch was holding his first exhibition in New
York at the Hotel Astor. General Brayton Ives,
Robert Hoe, and other great collectors of the glaring
‘80’s were beginning to form their libraries. My
friend was fascinated, and as he had no capital to
invest in great rarities himself, he thought he would
make a few. He determined to try his hand at
imitation.</p>

<p>Just about that period there was an awakened
interest in the ill-fated Major André, who had suffered
death as a British informer. In his grimy boarding
house on Grand Street my friend practiced imitating
André’s handwriting. He finally manufactured a
splendid letter in which Major André wrote to General
Washington requesting that he be shot as a
soldier and not hanged as a spy. As he described his
youthful fabrication his mouth lighted with a smile
of pleasure, and he confessed that he had been very
proud of this forgery; it had been a work of art!
He finally actually sold this pseudo-André letter for
$650! Those were the days when unpedigreed rarities
were more easily disposed of, as there were not
so many autograph sharks around as there are to-day.</p>

<p>Thirty years elapsed. My friend had grown in
riches and in reputation. Now he was a noted
collector; forgotten were the peccadillos of his youth.
In 1915, during the Great War, he noticed the advertisement
of a sale in London containing an André
letter. He cabled an unlimited bid, as was now his
custom. The letter was bought for him for £280.
A few weeks later, upon opening the package which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</span>
he received from the custom house, the inclosed
autograph letter looked familiar to him. A closer
scrutiny revealed the fact that he had bought back,
at three times what he had received for it, his own
fabrication!</p>

<p>Several years ago I had the remarkable good fortune
to secure for my own library a letter written by
Cervantes. It is the only one known in a private collection
to-day. Other letters of his—and they are
few—may be seen only in the Spanish National
Library at Madrid. Cervantes’s autographs are so
rare that the British Museum possesses no example
of the handwriting of the author of <i>Don Quixote</i>, nor
is there one in the library of the Hispanic Society in
New York City, founded by that great collector,
Mr. Archer M. Huntington. From this you may realize
to some extent the desirability and scarcity of a
letter of Cervantes. Written on two pages, and dated
February 4, 1593, it is extremely legible, in a bold
Castilian hand, and contains his signature in full:
Miguel de Cervantes Saavedra, with a fanciful
twirling flourish becoming to a great Spanish author.
Many an expert eye has passed upon it gloatingly
in years gone by, for it has been in the celebrated
collections, first of Benjamin Fillon, in Paris, and
later of Alfred Morrison, of London.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="f27">
<img src="images/fig27.jpg" alt="letter">
<p class="caption">LAST PAGE OF THE ONLY LETTER IN THIS COUNTRY WRITTEN<br>
BY CERVANTES</p>
</div>

<p>Some time after acquiring this celebrated autograph
I was startled one day in New York, when an
agent from a well-known English autograph house
telephoned me and said he had a wonderful letter of
Cervantes. He asked £3000 for it, which was certainly
not too high, when you stop to consider that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</span>
Cervantes’s place in literature is second only to that
of Shakespeare. If a Shakespeare letter were found
to-day many collectors would not consider $500,000
too much to pay for it. What, then, is a Cervantes
letter worth? While I sat mulling over these mathematical
problems, the doorbell rang and the dealer
came in. His manner was important, almost condescending.
His precious letter was inclosed in a
fine morocco case, elaborately tooled. He removed it
from its costly trappings, and after a moment of
suspense, which was really most effective, he handed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</span>
the letter to me. I could scarcely believe my eyes.
I looked for the date—February 4, 1593. It was an
excellently forged copy of the one in my possession.</p>

<p>“Where in the devil did you get this?”</p>

<p>His face turned the color of a carnation and his
swanky manner of assurance wilted away.</p>

<p>“Just what do you mean?” he asked me slowly.
I motioned him to follow, and took him into my book
vault, where I laid his clever forgery next to mine
the original. For a moment I thought he would
crumple up and fall to the floor. I have never seen
anyone so completely nonplussed. He had really
believed his Cervantes letter to be the original, and
had come in all good faith to sell it to me. I proved to
him how some forger, after securing the sheets of old
paper, had, through a process of photo-engraving,
cleverly produced the letter which he had so exultingly
shown to me.</p>

<p>The beautiful thing about the book business is that
you must be constantly on your guard. It makes the
game exciting to know that there are beings who, like
vultures, would pick your bones if you but gave them
the chance. Thank heaven for them. The chase is
more exhilarating on their account.</p>

<p>The atmosphere of Wall Street is that of a Quaker
meetinghouse beside it.</p>

<p class="caption">ORIGINAL DRAWING BY DAUMIER OF DON QUIXOTE</p>
</div>

<p>Forgeries have been in existence as long as the
collecting game itself. During the Renaissance forgers
were very active in every field of creative art.
Not only did they make imitations of great Greek and
Latin classics, which were just beginning their popular
vogue in Europe, but they very cleverly copied
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</span>old medals, and fabricated old gems too. Of course,
the collector himself is in a sense morally responsible
for the forger. The collector’s overdeveloped sense
of acquisitiveness leads him to pay extravagant prices
for his favorites; he will search out and buy every
available pen scratch of some great writer.</p>

<p>A poor wretch in an attic reads in the newspapers
that a capitalist has just paid $2000 for an autograph
letter of Robert Burns. He then begins to “discover”
other letters and documents by the same author.
This is the launching of a career that is usually full
of excitement and gives full scope to the imagination.
The forger is a picturesque figure until he, too, is
discovered and publicly condemned. This class of
men—I know of no women forgers—is responsible
for the literary detective. There is real sport in
tracking these fabrications. An ability to tell the
original from the false, the genuine from the spurious,
sometimes under the most trying circumstances,
has developed almost into a fine art.</p>

<p>There are men who make literary detecting their
profession. Their eyes are so well trained that they
are seldom wrong when pronouncing judgment.
They are as fully aware of the thousand and one
tricks of the professional forger’s game as they are
alert to the peculiarities of each author’s handwriting.</p>

<p>These experts could be numbered on the fingers of
one hand. When you stop to consider that there are
men even now in dark holes in London, in obscure garrets
in Paris, in flats in Harlem, and in apartments
in Atlantic City, making their livelihood forging<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</span>
autographs, it puts you pleasantly on your guard.
These fellows are very often unsuccessful authors
with a certain amount of erudition, broken-down
booksellers, or other bits of riffraff from the literary
world. I once knew a genial old college professor who
turned from unlucrative teaching to make an honest
penny, as he termed it, by forging.</p>

<p>My uncle Moses always told with a chuckle of his
experience with an Englishman by the name of
Robert Spring. He called at my uncle’s shop in
Commerce Street one day in the 60’s and said he had
an old document signed by Washington. In fact, it
was a military pass issued to some Revolutionary
worthy, permitting him to go through the lines.
My uncle naturally pricked up his ears at the mention
of his favorite character, General Washington,
and immediately asked to see this interesting relic.
The Englishman then held it up dramatically, and
when Uncle Moses read it he felt like embracing his
visitor. For, lo and behold, the pass was made out
in the name of one of my uncle’s own ancestors!</p>

<p>It had every earmark of age, was written on old
paper in faded ink, the creases were almost worn
through, and the edges were frayed. To his covetous
eyes the pass seemed much more desirable on account
of its connection with his forbears. He asked the
Englishman what he wanted for it and how it had
come into his possession. He glibly explained he had
found it in an old-fashioned hair trunk in the attic of
a house in old Philadelphia. He wanted fifteen dollars
for this pass—a large sum in those days, when one
could buy a full autograph letter of Washington for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</span>
that much money. Uncle Moses rose to this thin
story as a trout strikes at a fly.</p>

<p>Some years later Ferdinand J. Dreer, of Philadelphia,
a connoisseur, came to see him. Among
other things, my uncle showed him the faded pass.
Mr. Dreer looked at it for a moment, and then,
according to Uncle Moses, turned to him and in that
cheerfully disgusted tone which one collector uses to
a brother who has made a foolish deal, said:—</p>

<p>“Mr. Polock, you, of all men, should know better!
This thing is an arrant forgery, and worth less than
nothing.”</p>

<p>It later appeared that Robert Spring was the
first great forger of American documents. He had
written many such military passes, all of them with
spurious signatures of General Washington. But he
was always foxy enough to look up the name of some
ancestor of the man on whom he planned to prey.
Uncle Moses, nevertheless, remained stoical, and
said this outlay of fifteen dollars was one of the most
profitable investments he had ever made. It placed
him on his guard as nothing had before; was, in fact,
an investment that would in time be worth thousands
of dollars to him.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</span></p>

</div>

<p>Spring’s career as a forger lasted a surprisingly
long time. He reached a point where he made no
effort to conceal from his Philadelphia customers
the almost made-to-order character of these documents
of his. He salved their feelings by saying he
would never think of offering them anything that was
not genuine. Of course, he was an excellent penman.
Washington was his favorite model, perhaps because
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</span>he had greatest success in copying his handwriting.
He sold most of his productions to persons who lived
abroad, who were not regular collectors. He assumed
various names when he wrote to members of the
English nobility, representing himself sometimes as
a widow in want, or as the needy daughter of Stonewall
Jackson, thus feeding most lucratively upon the
kind-heartedness of wealthy people thousands of
miles away. He was arrested several times, but
finally reformed. Before dying he grew to be a most
proper and meticulously honest dealer in books and
engravings, and, I suppose, rests comfortably now
in the bookmen’s heaven.</p>

<p>I have collected letters and documents of Washington
almost from the beginning of my career. To-day
I own an interesting, authentic collection of
more than two hundred, written between the years
1755 and 1799. He was a prolific correspondent.
His handwriting is always legible; the writing of a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</span>
sensitive, clear-thinking person whose nerves were
under excellent control. Many of these letters are
the charming messages which any leisured gentleman
of that period might write. Others are on military
matters of the utmost importance. Another series
deals entirely with agriculture, and shows how well
the masterly general could play the gentleman
farmer.</p>

<p>The years which have passed since his death have
seen the world flooded with Washington autographs.
But it took a measure of daring and a fanatical
spirit of patriotism to forge letters of his while he
was still alive and fulfilling with vigor the now historical
duties of his military career. It was in May or
June of 1777 that a book appeared in London purporting
to contain certain letters of Washington
written in 1776 to friends and relatives of his in
Virginia. These letters paint him as a man whose
motives were questionable. The false lines in this
book relate his pretended thoughts and feelings
about the Revolution in which he was then engaged.
They make him say he is tired of it all; that he wishes
for peace at any price with the mother country.
They reveal him as a military scapegrace with the
soul, but not the courage, of a traitor! Despite the
publisher’s preface explaining his possession of these
intimate documents, it was soon proved that the
letters were deliberate forgeries. Nevertheless, they
were of grave importance at the time, for they served
as a powerful propaganda against Washington, and
therefore the colonies, and made a strong appeal to
the ignorant and easily biased mind.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</span></p>

<p>Forgers must have, above all, a keen sense of chronology.
This is the first great requisite after their
natural skill in imitating handwriting. For instance,
they cannot refer to the discovery of America in a
letter supposed to have been written before that
event took place, or date a letter of Dickens, 1872,
two years after his death, and expect to get away with
it. Both these slips, strange to say, have occurred.
In fact, forgers frequently make similar crude errors,
alluding to incidents that hadn’t happened at the
time the letter was dated.</p>

<p>It is plain, therefore, that the master forger must
have his chronology at his finger tips. He should
know not only the dates of history, which he can
find in any textbook, but he must be familiar with
the history of costume, of furnishings, and decorations
also. I remember reading the invention of one
gentleman’s brain and pen in which he alluded to
hoop skirts ten years before they put in their dreadful
appearance. The literary forger hoping for success
should also acquire an almost endless knowledge of
the colloquial language of the period in which he
writes, and must be naturally a student of orthography
and spelling. In fact, he has taken up the one
career where he has literally to mind his P’s and Q’s!</p>

<p>It is fairly easy to imitate the writing of a distinguished
character; the most difficult part is to
interpret, as well, the thoughts of the equally distinguished
mind. A forger of Thackeray wrote the
name of the author of <i>Vanity Fair</i> in many volumes,
together with a short comment about the text. He
composed a pointed criticism of each work, or
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</span>invented what he believed to be some smart phrase
about the author. In this case the signature and the
writing itself are so excellent that they almost defy
detection, but the thoughts are no more those of the
great Thackeray than are mine of Shakespeare.</p>

</div>

<p>Not many are privileged to see presentation copies
actually in the making. A friend of mine told me of
an experience he had in London. One day he strolled
into a little bookshop near the British Museum. He
looked over some dusty volumes for a time, and
finally found one which he wanted to buy. There
was no clerk in the front of the shop, so he walked to
the rear, where he discovered a little old man seated
at a large table. Before him was a row of books all
opened at the title pages. The busy old fellow was
bent over another and so absorbed in his work that he
heard nothing. My friend looked over his shoulder.
He was committing a little quiet forgery! In other
words he was caught in “fragrant delectation.” On
the title page he was painstakingly forming Lewis
Carroll’s autograph. Before my friend left he had
an opportunity to see what was written. He found,
much to his astonishment, that the old gentleman
was inditing to long-deceased friends of Lewis
Carroll, copies of <i>Alice in Wonderland</i>, each one with
an appropriate inscription. When asked the reason
for all this industry, he replied, “I am making them
for the American market!”</p>

<p>Among the many bugaboos which the forger has
to face are watermarks woven into paper. These are
the manufacturer’s trade-marks, and often show the
date the paper was made. You can see them if you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</span>
hold the paper to the light. Quite recently I was
offered three manuscripts supposed to be in the hand
of Oscar Wilde. His exquisite though affected Greek
style of handwriting was well enough imitated. But
when I pointed out to the man who offered the manuscripts
to me that they were written upon paper
which bore the watermarks of a manufacturer who
had made it during the Great War, he suddenly
remembered an appointment and hurriedly made his
departure.</p>

<p>About twenty years ago a celebrated French firm
of book and autograph dealers cabled my brother
Philip that they were offering for sale the original
manuscript of Oscar Wilde’s <i>Salomé</i>. Wilde, who
was a literary exhibitionist if ever there was one, gave
<i>Salomé</i> to the world in French, and not such very
good French at that. As I had an extensive collection
of Wilde autographs even then, I was extremely
eager to own the original of this famous work also.
Before my reply could reach the firm in France,
some luckier collector who was on the spot at the
time bought it. I was very much annoyed, but concealed
my chagrin as best I could, not even inquiring
who the buyer was. I suspected it was some French
author. The year before last, when on my annual
pilgrimage to England, a French journalist came to
see me one day at the Carlton Hotel in London,
with the news that he knew the man who owned the
<i>Salomé</i> manuscript, and was informed that he would
part with it if paid a sufficiently high price.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</span></p>

<div class="figcenter" id="f32">

<p class="caption">PAGE FROM ORIGINAL MANUSCRIPT OF OSCAR WILDE’S<br>

</div>

<p>Now, I am never frightened at high prices. I
asked my friend to return to France and buy it for
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</span>me. Two days passed. Then I received the news
that I was again too late. It was plain that Salomé
was playing hide and seek with me, and placing my
head on a charger. After two months in England I
went to Paris. I had hardly arrived before the collector
who last purchased <i>Salomé</i> offered to sell it.
I asked him to bring it immediately to my hotel.
With my nerves on edge, I kept telling myself that
this time she should not escape me. Now, the collector
in question was supposed to be a judge of
autographs. He arrived and took the manuscript
from its case. I fairly grabbed it from him, fearing
that the evil Salomé would sprout wings and fly out
of the window. I opened the cover to the first page,
looked at it, turned the second, then the third.
Quickly I closed it and gave it back to him. A silence
followed during which he regarded me in amazement.</p>

<p>“No, thank you,” I said; “I am looking for
Salomé in the flesh, not a will-o’-the-wisp. Your
manuscript is a forgery!”</p>

<p>It was plain this poor fellow had been deceived.
He walked up and down my room, tearing at his hair
in the best French manner, for he had given a good
sum for this clever fabrication. I, too, was deeply
disappointed, after tracking over Europe for it.
Like the villain in the play, Salomé still evaded me.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</span></p>

TO MRS. PATRICK CAMPBELL</p>
</div>

<p>In Philadelphia a year later I received a cable from
a firm of auctioneers in Paris, offering me the original
manuscript of <i>Salomé</i> once more. I naturally paid no
attention to the offer, thinking it another forgery.
I was tired of the wiles of this wicked woman. I had
come to the conclusion that this work was not, by
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</span>some weaving of the fates, for the house of Rosenbach.
No more fool’s errands for me.</p>

<p>A few weeks after, when dining with a well-known
American collector in New York, he said to me:</p>

<p>“Doctor, I have something which will open even
your eyes. I have <i>Salomé</i>!”</p>

<p>Naturally, I could not suppress a cynical laugh.
“Another forgery?” I smilingly inquired.</p>

<p>After dinner we went to his library, and he pointed
very proudly to two old copy books on the table.
The moment I looked at the pages I knew that at
last I held the original in my hands. How envious I
was! But I now realized this manuscript could never
be mine. I felt truly heartbroken. My friend, seeing
I was not exactly elated over his treasure, but rather
downcast, asked the reason. I related the whole
story of my chase.</p>

<p>With great generosity he replied, with the air of
a sultan presenting a favorite slave, “Doctor, I
don’t want to stand in your way. If you want her,
she is yours.” He told me its history as far as he
knew it; the manuscript had been purchased by
Pierre Louÿs, the eminent French poet. It was he
who had bought it directly from the shop in Paris
when I first tried to obtain it twenty years before. It
is far more precious to-day than it was then. Not
only is it the greatest work from the pen of Oscar
Wilde but it is the one work of his that has been
translated into all languages. It has also been used
as the libretto by Richard Strauss for his startling
and beautiful opera.</p>

<p>The up-to-date literary forger always keeps his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</span>
eye upon the market. Genuine letters of certain
famous, or infamous, men and women will always
command high prices. Yet the styles in collecting
change as in everything else. One decade there may
be a sudden craze for Byron letters; the next, autograph
letters or documents pertaining to Keats or
Shelley are frantically sought.</p>

<p>So it goes. One cycle begins as another cycle ends.
Therefore, forgers’ productions often swarm into the
market when the popularity of an autograph is on
the crest of the wave. There are certain historical
characters whose autographs will always sell at top
prices. With this in mind, one of the greatest hoaxes
ever planned was, for a time, put over by a French
forger a few years after the middle of the nineteenth
century. Vrain Lucas was his name, and his guileless
customer was a noted mathematician, Michel
Chasles. I first knew of Lucas’s wretched forgeries
through hearing my uncle Moses tell of them; in a
way, it was rather humorous, for when he told me
the story he became as enraged as though Lucas had
taken him in, rather than Chasles.</p>

<p>Vrain Lucas was a middle-aged man of fair education
and rather well read. By his own confession he
had manufactured more than twenty-five thousand
spurious autographs, many of which he sold to
Chasles over a period of eight years. During that
time Chasles had doubted his word only once. Lucas
immediately offered to buy back everything he had
sold him, and thus Chasles’s faith was restored.</p>

<p>This charlatan, Lucas, must have had a certain
hypnotic influence over Chasles, plus the assurance<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</span>
and the courage of Old Nick himself. Chasles’s
belief in him, however, proved Lucas’s undoing. For
when he sold him two letters from Charles V to
Rabelais, Chasles, in his excitement and delight,
presented them to the Academy of Belgium. The
letters for a time were believed to be genuine. Then
Lucas came again to Chasles, this time with letters
from Pascal to Boyle and Sir Isaac Newton, in
which the writer proved that he, and not Newton,
had discovered the law of gravitation.</p>

<p>You can imagine how deeply moved was Chasles,
the naïve mathematician. He rushed with them to
the French Academy of Science, and at once the
scientific world was stirred into a commotion. At
the height of this agitation Sir David Brewster came
forward and announced that the letters must be from
the pen of an impostor, proving conclusively at the
same time that Newton was a mere child of ten when
these pretended messages of Pascal were written.
Thus began the beginning of the end for the forger.</p>

<p>Certain testimony given by Chasles at Lucas’s
trial before a tribunal of the Seine, in 1870, is almost
unbelievable. It seems ridiculous to me that any
man, especially a collector, could have been so simple
and gullible as was Chasles. He spent 140,000 francs,
a lot of money in those days, for a list of autograph
letters that is too good to pass over lightly. Although
Monsieur Lucas supplied his customer with the important
names of the fifteenth, sixteenth, and seventeenth
centuries, including Boccaccio, Cervantes,
Dante, Racine, Shakespeare, and Spinoza, he likewise
delved into the remote past and produced letters<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</span>
from Abélard, Alcibiades, Attila, Julius Cæsar, Charlemagne,
Ovid, Pliny, Plutarch, and Pompey!</p>

<p>Lucas was careful enough to mix an ink for his
forgeries which, when dry, gave the appearance of
age. Then he treated the completed masterpieces
in such a way as to make them look worn and of
great age. But his cleverness was only half-witted!
He had the audacity not only to write these ancient
epistles on paper from local mills, which showed the
watermarks of Angoulême, but most daringly inscribed
them in modern French!</p>

<p>The late Simon Gratz, in his delightful and authoritative
volume, <i>A Book about Autographs</i>, gives
translations of several of these shameless fabrications.
Here is the letter which Chasles believed
Cleopatra wrote to Julius Cæsar:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Cleopatra, Queen, to her very beloved Julius Cæsar,
Emperor.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My very beloved</span>:—</p>

<p>Our son Cæsarion is well. I hope that he will soon be
able to support the travel from here to Marseilles, where
I need to send him to study, as much for the good air one
breathes there as for the fine things which are taught. I
beg you will tell me how long you will still remain in that
country, for I want myself to take our son there and see
you on this occasion. This is to tell you, my very beloved,
the pleasure I feel when I am near you, and meanwhile I

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">My dear friend Petrus</span>:—</p>

<p>You tell me you have noticed in the writings of Cæsar
and in those of Cicero that one of the most important
parts of the Druids’ religion consists in sacrificing savage
men. It is true they take in an erroneous sense this principle,
that men can only appreciate the life God gave them
by offering Him the life of a man. They have continued
that inhuman and bloody practice until the time of
Cicero. This is why he says they soil and profane their
temple and altars by offering there human victims, and
here Cicero is right in insulting a worship so barbarous,
saying it is a strange thing that to satisfy for what they
owe to their religion they must first dishonor it by some
murder. They cannot be religious without being homicides.
The infamy of this horrible maxim has reflected
on all the Gauls, even if it has been practiced only in some
places. But the arms and the conquest of the Romans
have wiped out this infamy and I do not believe that it is
practiced anywhere now. Amen.</p>

<p>Lucas’s interpretation of Biblical characters was
rather unusual. Perhaps it was this quality, which so
fascinated his generous customer, that caused him
to be blind to obvious discrepancies. Here is rather a
quaint letter purporting to be from Mary Magdalene
to Lazarus:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">My very beloved brother</span>:—</p>

<p>That which you tell us of Petrus, the Apostle of our
meek Jesus, gives us hope that soon we shall see him
here and I dispose myself to receive him well. Our sister
Martha also rejoices of it. Her health is very tottering
and I fear her passing away. This is why I recommend
her to your good prayers. The good girls who have come
to place themselves under our guidance are admirable for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</span>
us and make us the most amiable caresses. It is enough
said, my very beloved brother, that our sojourn in these
countries of the Gaul pleases us much, that we have no
desire to leave it, also none of our friends suggest it. Do
you not think that those Gauls who were thought barbarian
nations are not at all so, and judging only by what
we have learned it must be from these that the light of
science started. I have a great desire to see you and beg
our Lord may have you in favor.</p>

secrecy, for it is a profanation of their value; and no more
render them public without my consent. As to what you
asked of me, to travel to the country of the Gauls in order
to learn the sciences of the Druids, of whom Pythagoras
made so fine a eulogy, not only do I permit you but I entreat
you to go for the good of my people, as you are not

<p>Old Chasles got all that was coming to him, and
the 140,000 francs that he spent on the Lucas inventions
were as nothing compared with the great joy
the world in general, and antiquarians in particular,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</span>
have experienced in reading these altogether amusing
epistles.</p>

<p>Being sometimes called a pirate myself, I have
always been interested in reading about them. I
remember reveling in <i>Treasure Island</i>, soon after it
appeared in 1883. But instead of the pieces of eight
and flashing gems which Stevenson conjured up for
the boyish mind, I substituted, in my youthful
imagination, rare books. This seems far-fetched, yet
it is absolutely true. Instead of Long John Silver’s
doubloons and sequins, I put in their place first editions
and manuscripts. They were more to me, then
and now, than all the treasure of the Indies. And
yet, in the first years of my passion for them, I rarely
gave thought to forgeries. I had that superb reliance
upon instinct which is a part and parcel of youth.
I felt that if there were forgeries about I could sniff
them as a dog follows a scent. So I was not really
interested in forgers and their works until I read in a
book for the first time an account of William Henry
Ireland, the greatest fabricator of them all.</p>

<p>Ireland was a youthful scamp, less than eighteen
years old, who in 1795 pulled the leg of almost the
entire literary world with his “discovery” of many
Shakespearean manuscripts. He was the son of an
engraver in London, and doubtless inherited the
facile fingers which brought him his peculiar fame.
Ireland senior reverenced all relics of antiquity, and
especially those which were connected with the
memory of Shakespeare. He was almost a fanatic on
this subject and gave his son to understand that his
greatest desire would be satisfied the day that he
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</span>was lucky enough to find an autograph manuscript
of the Bard of Avon. I’ve had that feeling myself.
After being dragged hither and yon by his father,
who searched every nook and cranny where Shakespeare
was supposed to have stayed, the filial William
Henry decided upon a course of his own to make his
father completely happy.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="f34">

<p class="caption">FORGERY OF SHAKESPEARE MANUSCRIPT<br>
BY WILLIAM HENRY IRELAND</p>
</div>

<p>He was apprenticed at the time to an attorney,
and it was a part of his daily work to study ancient
documents, such as leases and wills. He sometimes
read in books the histories of various estates in
Great Britain, and occasionally a facsimile of Shakespeare’s
signature was printed in them. One day he
came across some unused parchment at the end of
an old rent roll. His imagination began to work, I
suppose, as he studied the Shakespeare facsimile
before him, and the echoes of old deeds, with their
quaint phrases, doubtless rang in his ears. Thus he
set about practising the penmanship of an earlier
era. Finding that he wrote with amazing ease, he
immediately made up a lease between William
Shakespeare and John Heminge, with one Michael
Fraser and Elizabeth, his wife. When the ink was
sufficiently dried he took it home to his father, who
at the sight of it nearly dropped dead with joy.
And so began young Ireland’s notorious performances.</p>

<p>After finding further facsimiles of signatures of the
Elizabethan period, he invented, with the most
appalling facility, all sorts of letters and poems.
Naturally, his father and others asked where he had
found these remarkable manuscripts, whereupon he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</span>
made up a more or less logical story. He said he
had met a gentleman of fortune, whose name he had
sworn not to tell, in a coffeehouse in London, and
that in the course of conversation they had discovered
each other’s love for things antique. The
new acquaintance then mentioned having in his
possession a collection of old deeds and papers tied
in bundles. The boy told of his delight at being
asked to inspect them; and how he had gone to his
friend’s house and searched through them. Much to
their mutual joy, he had discovered one old paper
which clearly established his friend’s right to a certain
property which had been the subject of litigation
for a long time. This friend, he went on to
explain, first swore him to secrecy, then presented
him with as many of these ancient manuscripts as he
wished to have.</p>

<p>It is not difficult to understand why William
Henry’s father accepted his boy’s story so easily.
Remember, those were the days of stern virtues. A
son brought up to respect his parents was expected
to tell the truth. When the elder Ireland, being a
man of substantial reputation, showed the manuscripts
to his friends and repeated his son’s story, it
was accepted. Spurred on by his apparent success in
deceiving his father and many visitors, the young
forger began to lose his head and daily grew more
daring. Under cover of secrecy, in a lonely room
where he was apprenticed, he had the temerity not
only to forge Shakespeare’s signature to documents
but to invent an autograph confession of faith for
him. This met with success, and he proceeded to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</span>
compose love lyrics in the form of letters to Anne
Hathaway, signed with the name of the great poet.</p>

<p>Here is one of them, in which he inclosed a lock of
“thye Willys” hair. It is addressed to Anna Hatherrewaye,
and reads as follows:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Sometime later he made an almost entire transcript
of <i>Lear</i>, and a few leaves from <i>Hamlet</i>, too! In
<i>Hamblette</i>, as he quaintly called it, he boldly introduced
variations in the text, which many of the most
learned men of the time read without doubting their
authenticity. Boswell, Doctor Johnson’s famous
biographer, called at the Ireland home one day,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</span>inspected the manuscripts, then knelt down before
them, enthusiastically kissing a paper here and
there as he thanked God for letting him live to see
them.</p>

<p>However, there was one doubting Thomas, who
refused to believe, almost from the beginning of the
“discoveries,” that there was an iota of truth concerning
their origin. His name was Edmund Malone.
He was the one literary critic who did not make a
fool of himself at any time during a controversy
which later developed to a furious pitch, and resulted
in a full published confession from Ireland.</p>

<p>Young Ireland’s final burst of inspiration led him
to write a pretended play of Shakespeare, entitled
<i>Vortigern and Rowena</i>. This was the straw which
eventually broke the camel’s back, but not until
Sheridan had produced it, with two of the foremost
players of the day, John Philip Kemble and Mrs. Jordan,
appearing in the leading rôles.</p>

<p>Ireland appealed to me, not because he was a
forger but because of a certain further cleverness.
When he was discovered and his misdeeds revealed to
a curious world, there suddenly sprang up a great
demand to behold the handiwork of this delectable
young villain. People in England, and collectors and
curio seekers everywhere, wanted to own specimens
of his fraudulent but interesting papers. They were
so much in demand that he was kept busy from
morning to night making forgeries of his own forgeries.</p>

<p>The sudden demand was not for Shakespeare’s own
letter to Anne Hathaway but for Ireland’s original<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</span>
imaginary manuscript. What, then, could the poor
fellow do? He just had to sit himself down and ply
his trade as long as his supply of old paper and
precious ink held out.</p>

<p>It was these humorous and at the same time
dramatic facts which touched my imagination as a
collector. I wanted Ireland’s original forgeries, not
his double and triple fabrications. I naturally wanted
the original manuscript of <i>Vortigern</i>, the one the
lovely Mrs. Jordan had reverently held in her adoring—and
adorable—hands. I thought I knew
where they were—in the collection of the Marquis
of Blandford, to whom they were sold many years
ago. Imagine my surprise when I purchased the
library of Marsden J. Perry, of Providence, to discover
in his world-famed collection the actual forgeries
not only of <i>Vortigern</i> but of <i>King Lear</i> and <i>Hamlet</i>
as well. Here were the original documents which had
deceived some of the choicest minds in England.
Looking further, I also found the first draft of Ireland’s
confession. I have the actual drafts with
which Richard Brinsley Sheridan was so delighted;
the very pages from which Kemble studied the part
of Vortigern, and before which Boswell knelt, “a
tumbler of warm brandy and water” at his side.</p>

<p>Ireland was not the first spectacular forger of
tender years. In his confession he speaks of having
been influenced by reading of Thomas Chatterton’s
career. Chatterton was an English youth who kept
the literary world titillating twenty-five years earlier.
It is a strange thing, this psychologic kink which
sometimes forms in the brains of very young men.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</span>
Why they should risk bringing the world about their
ears through impersonating the famous dead, when
they have brains and originality of their own, no
one knows.</p>

<p>Poor Chatterton! His is the only great genius
which has come to light through the art of forgery.
He began writing when he was sixteen, and almost
from the beginning produced some of the finest
poetry in the history of eighteenth-century literature.
Perhaps he was unhappily shy, as boys often
are at that age; or he may have suffered from some
gloomy mental obsession. His manner of screening
his identity when these remarkable poems first appeared
has caused many a student to pause and
wonder.</p>

<p>Chatterton’s first writings appeared with an
accompanying explanation. He said his father had
found them years before in an ancient chest belonging
to the Church of St. Mary Redcliffe at Bristol.
The verses were supposed to have been composed by
Thomas Rowley, a monk who had lived in that
neighborhood during the fifteenth century. Chatterton,
according to his story, had merely copied them.
At first, this story was accepted, while critics praised
the undeniable beauty of the lines. Then some contemporary
littérateur called attention to the incorrect
usage of Anglo-Saxon words of Rowley’s day, and
suspicion hovered over Chatterton. It was soon
charged that Chatterton had written the poems of
Rowley, using a certain dictionary from which he
chose Anglo-Saxon words in order to create the
atmosphere and flavor of antiquity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</span></p>

<p>Among his critics were Horace Walpole and his
two poet friends, Mason and Gray. The boy was
accused of downright forgery when it was further
noted that the poem which Chatterton brought out
as the “Battle of Hastings wrote by Turgot the
Monk, in the tenth century, and translated by
Thomas Rowlie,” was wrongly dated. This bit of
carelessness on Chatterton’s part increased the hue
and cry of ridicule. The Battle of Hastings, as every
English schoolboy knew, did not take place until
the eleventh century! And here the poetic Turgot
was relating its history one century before it happened.
The goading of Walpole and his acolytes
finally drove Chatterton to commit suicide when he
was only eighteen years of age.</p>

<p>What a loss it was to England!</p>

<p>Walpole, seated in his comfortable library at
Strawberry Hill, surrounded by his precious books
and his precious ladies, recognized Chatterton’s
works as forgeries, but did not recognize his superb
genius. A few of the inspired lines of Chatterton’s
poems are worth all the famous letters which Walpole
so elegantly wrote for a large public, including himself.
Although we wade with zest in the delightful
mud stream that, with its scandal and veiled allusions,
runs so naughtily through Walpole’s correspondence,
we can never forgive his treatment of
poor Chatterton.</p>

<p>Not quite in the same class as a forgery, a quaint
and equally difficult sister art has gradually sprung
into existence, called the facsimile page. Not that
I mean to imply that the making of such pages<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</span>
is always done with an intent to deceive. There is a
concern in London which supplies missing pages on
order for any book you may have—a business that
is done quite openly. Suppose you own a copy of
the first edition of one of Shakespeare’s folios, in
which either the title or last leaf is missing. If you
don’t happen to be too fastidious and have merely
the collector’s love for the complete, without his
obsession for the perfect as well, you could take
your first folio to this firm and in a short time receive
a perfect page made to match the others of your
book. Only the connoisseur and you yourself would
know the difference.</p>

<p>Owing to the assistance of the camera to-day and
the modern processes of engraving, it is not difficult
to reproduce the printed word as it first appeared
several centuries ago. The snag comes, however, in
finding a paper that is exactly contemporaneous with
the book itself. This London house happens to have
a large and wonderful collection of old papers, taken
chiefly from the flyleaves of early volumes. There
are many unscrupulous dealers in the world, even in
New York, who do not acknowledge to their customers
that a book which they offer as genuine is
made up in this manner. Any reputable firm would
immediately call attention to it. One not quite so
particular, with the naïveté of a child, always pleads,
when caught, that he was ignorant of the guilty leaf,
not being an expert himself. And yet he had ordered
the damning page from the London house of facsimiles.</p>

<p>But sometimes it is almost impossible to tell which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</span>
leaves in a book are facsimile. About seventy-five
years ago there was an expert in this line in England
by the name of Harris. With the greatest dexterity
and cunning, he made leaves for incomplete books,
which exactly duplicated the original ones. In those
days such work was tedious and had to be accomplished
entirely by hand, as it was long before the era
of modern photographs. Harris’s work was in constant
demand. An amusing story is told among
booksellers of an order Harris executed for a celebrated
collector whose copy of Caxton’s <i>History of
Troy</i> had two leaves missing. Five years later the
collector called on Harris. He took this Caxton
from his pocket and showed it to him. It was with
the greatest difficulty that Harris himself could
determine which two leaves were his. In fact, he had
to verify them by his records.</p>

<p>If there are great holes or tears in old pages they
can be filled in in such a marvelous manner as almost
to defy detection. Here again the literary detective
enters to discover a clew and solve the mystery. The
fellow must have a specialized sense for this sort of
thing, just as a born newspaperman has a nose for
news. The true literary detective will tell you at a
glance if anything is wrong with a printed page.
This is a rare faculty, and in the book business
amounts almost to genius. Some booksellers are
never able to tell, during their entire careers, which
are facsimile leaves and which aren’t. Only a few
are adept at it.</p>

<p>Another trick is to supply original covers when
they are missing from old and precious volumes.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</span>
Sometimes a copy of an English classic appears in the
auction room minus its blue or gray or yellow paper
wrappers. In the twinkling of an eye brand-new
ones are supplied, aged by the miraculous antiquer,
and offered as being in pristine, immaculate state,
“very rare in its original paper binding.”</p>

<p>Then, to enhance the illusion, an old signature is
added to the cover and perhaps the price, “tuppence,”
written in an old hand. It takes Sherlock
Holmes himself to detect these impostures.</p>

<p>I know a gentleman in London who is so expert
in detecting forgeries that he goes on a scent like a
setter after a bird. But the real safeguard for the
collector is to buy his books, not from the transient
individual who has two or three bargains to offer, but
from the man who is known first of all for his reputable
dealing. Then collecting is sheer delight.</p>

<p><span class="smcap large">The</span> First Folio had lain idly at anchor for two long,
sultry days. Then, as a miniature gale swept the
threatening clouds of a summer storm across Corson’s
Inlet just before twilight on the second day, I
bowed to the will of the fisherman’s god, whoever
he may be, and hurried down the beach. Ordinarily
I am not the sort of fisherman who waits for the
psychological moment, but here it was upon me.
After such weather, fish were sure to strike.</p>

<p>As I rowed out to my boat, I heard the telephone
bell ring in the house I had just left. It had been an
exhausting week for me; every bibliomaniac in the
vicinity of Philadelphia had had a book to show
and sell me, and my office had telephoned upon the
slightest provocation. So when I heard that bell I
pulled for the First Folio as though the devil were
after me, and carefully rounding the bow, drew up
on the port side away from the shore. Once aboard,
the captain started the engine and made for the
open sea. Even then I could not avoid seeing my
man Harrison waving frantically from the beach.</p>

<p class="caption">LETTER OF FRANKLIN FROM PHILADELPHIA, 1775</p>
</div>

<p>Only the born Izaak Walton knows that lazy defiance
of the world’s demands which comes with a
rod and reel in one’s hand. Soon I was fishing; forgotten
was the realm of books and manuscripts,
forgotten the boring persistence of telephone bells,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</span>forgotten poor Harrison on the shore—forgotten
everything in the world except the delight of a strike,
the thrilling moments of playing my catch, and the
breath-taking suspense of reeling in. How long I
fished I don’t know. The sun emerged again in time
to set, as the wind died out completely. I refuse to
tell the number of fish I caught, for no one would
believe me; but with the advent of a fine six-pounder
I felt quite satisfied. I walked to a low deck chair
and sat, resting. Perhaps I dozed for a few minutes;
I don’t know. Suddenly I heard my name. I opened
my eyes and was surprised to find the shore close by.
We had forgotten to anchor and were drifting in.</p>

<p>“Doctah—doctah!” Harrison’s voice lost its
slow drawl in excitement. “Mistah Lawlah done
phone all dis afternoon! Why fo’ you don’ answah
me, doctah? He say he done fin’ ole Mistah Franklin’s
work book.”</p>

<p>How often had hopeful bookmen dreamed of
one day discovering this work book of Benjamin
Franklin! From my earliest days of collecting, I
myself had persistently followed all rumors or clews
concerning its whereabouts. None of them led anywhere.
I even doubted that it still existed.</p>

<p>“Harrison,” I replied, “you can tell Mr. Lawler
that I am not exactly partial to a fool’s errand on a
hot day. Besides, I want to fish.” He went indoors,
shouted my words over the telephone, then bolted
down to the shore again.</p>

<p>“Oh, Lawdy, doctah, do come to de telephone!
He sho am mad if you don’t.”</p>

<p>When I reached the house I explained once more<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</span>
to the manager of my Philadelphia place that I
wished to be left alone to fish.</p>

<p>“Fish!” Mr. Lawler’s tone was derisive. “Why,
if you’ll take the next train and meet me in Camden,
I’ll show you where you can land a fish bigger than
anything you could ever pull out of Corson’s Inlet!”
This was bait for me, if not for the fish, and I asked
for fuller information.</p>

<p>It seemed that after months of patient search Mr.
Lawler had located the proprietor of an antique shop
at Mount Holly, New Jersey, who owned an old copy
book which he claimed was the original in which
Franklin kept his accounts. Mr. Lawler had already
seen it, and believed it to be authentic; and though
I rather dreaded being disappointed once more,
there was the chance of a find. I left for the station
immediately; there I found no train due for hours.
This was doubtless just the obstacle I needed to egg
me on. I quickly hired an automobile and motored
the seventy miles to Camden. Mr. Lawler met me.
He seemed nervous and in a great hurry to make
the final lap of our pilgrimage. We had twenty miles
farther to go, and as we sped along we discussed the
printer’s long-lost work book.</p>

<p>Franklin had mentioned its existence in various
writings and letters. He had said that when he was
a printer he kept all the records of his business in it.</p>

<p>At last we came to Mount Holly, and as we followed
a quiet country street to its end I regretted
the trip. The heat of the summer night was oppressive,
and the entrance of the shop before which we
stopped was the same as a thousand others scattered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</span>
over the country. A dull light reflected against the
usual sign, “Antiques,” hanging above the doorway.
As I entered, a sensation of futility came over me.
The rosewood whatnots holding their bits and pieces
of glass or china depressed me; broken-down Windsors,
old ships’ lanterns, hooked rugs, maple chests,
and mahogany bureaus—was this atmosphere conducive
to hope? I doubted it, and looked at Mr. Lawler
with an accusatory eye. But so great was his excitement
now that he had forgotten my existence.
Suddenly his face lighted.</p>

<p>The proprietor of the shop, a calm, middle-aged
man, came forward. He greeted me, smiling kindly.
I must confess this smile revived hope. He seemed
sure of himself in a quiet sort of way. I began to
think that perhaps I hadn’t come on such a wild-goose
chase after all. He was at his desk now, an
old desk littered with papers. As his fingers searched
through them I watched closely. Then, when he
finally drew a long narrow book from beneath a pile
of letters, I caught my breath.</p>

<p>I took it from him and went to the dim light. As
I opened the battered covers I immediately recognized
the work book of “the first civilized American,”
as a recent biographer has so aptly called him. Not
a page had been tampered with; it was entirely as it
had been kept for Franklin, except that it was somewhat
yellowed by its hundred and eighty years of
age. Very carefully he had listed each work printed
by his press. The title of every book, the number of
copies made, and the quality of paper used, all commercial
details, the costs and selling prices, were
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</span>methodically written out. Other expenses, too, were
set down.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="f37">
<img src="images/fig37.jpg" alt="work book">
<p class="caption">PAGE OF FRANKLIN’S WORK BOOK</p>
</div>

<p>I looked at Mr. Lawler gratefully, and he, inwardly
gloating, acted as though the finding of historically
invaluable account books was all in an
evening’s work. Of course, I could not leave without
it, and I lost no time in buying it from the owner.
Ten minutes later two jubilant bookmen climbed
into the waiting automobile outside, making a triumphal
exit as they carried off their treasure from
the town of Mount Holly.</p>

<p>It was impossible to realize, when I purchased it,
the full historical worth of Franklin’s account book.
Not until I returned home, where I found leisure to
study every word, to compare the contents with
published facts concerning Franklin, did I recognize
its true import and value to all students of printing
in this country. But how did it happen to be in
Mount Holly after all those years? This question
obsessed me for a long time. The former owner,
from whom I purchased it, could tell me nothing. I
began searching through the records of Franklin’s
career as a printer, and found he was in business with
David Hall until 1766, at which time they dissolved
their partnership. Then it was that he requested
his great friend, James Parker, a noted printer in
New York, to audit the accounts for him. Later
Parker moved to Burlington, New Jersey, probably
taking this account book with him. As Burlington
is but a few miles from Mount Holly, it is not difficult
to imagine how it might have been carried there
by some one of Parker’s descendants.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</span></p>

<p>Many people imagine they own things of great
worth, especially if these things are old. They become
excited when they run across a letter in some
trunk which has not been opened for years. They are
sure they have found the pot of gold at the end of
the rainbow. They are severely shocked, however,
when the experienced dealer’s appraisal of the ancestral
letters is extremely low. Indeed, the dealer
is quite different from the law courts of England,
which consider a man innocent until he is proved
guilty. Every expert is more or less suspicious of
any proffered autograph, especially if the so-called
originals are supposed to have been written by celebrated
figures of a century or so ago.</p>

<p>The false scent and the fruitless hunt, these the
skillful buyer learns to avoid. Sometimes the letters
are genuine—sometimes! But it is amazing, too,
what tales otherwise honest men and women will
fabricate in their eagerness to sell an autograph letter
or document. They will swear to heaven that they
remember that auspicious day, “over forty years
ago, when I was but a mere child,” when the letter
was first shown them. I have had many such experiences.
Several times I have recognized straight
forgeries, letters which were actually written quite
recently, and clumsily made to appear old and important.
However, there are times when one is due
for a delightful surprise. What you believe to be
idle vaporings turn out to be something delightfully
different.</p>

<p>One day some years ago an old gentleman called
upon me in New York. I happened to be walking<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</span>
through my reception room when he arrived, and
did not catch his name. But in deference to his extreme
age—he appeared to be more than ninety—I
immediately invited him into the library. He was
very plainly dressed, almost dingy in appearance.
I entered into conversation with him and he seemed
remarkably well informed. Every celebrity of the
past sixty years he appeared to know intimately. We
talked of prominent literary figures, of great political
and financial leaders. He knew them all!</p>

<p>He even told me of an incident which occurred one
evening at Windsor Castle when he dined with Queen
Victoria. I looked at him queryingly, deploring that
exaggerated ego which is the pleasure and consolation
of old age. He continued with anecdotes of
Palmerston, Gladstone, Disraeli, and Lord Salisbury.
Lincoln had been his friend, he said, as well as all
the Presidents from Lincoln’s time; and every corner
and crevice of the White House was known to him.
I thought to myself that here was certainly an old
liar, if ever there was one. A regular Baron Munchausen!</p>

<p>Then I naturally turned the conversation to old
books and manuscripts. I mentioned a famous
volume, and he said he owned it. I mentioned another;
he owned that too! If he had been a younger
man I should have had it clearly understood that I
no longer cared to be taken for a credulous fool. But
being a Philadelphian, of course I could not resist
mentioning Benjamin Franklin. The syllables of
his name had hardly left my lips when my visitor
announced, with something of regret in his voice,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</span>
that he had once owned the manuscript of Franklin’s
famous <i>Autobiography</i>!</p>

<p>With unbelieving amazement I stared at him.
Then it dawned upon me that the gentleman before
me was a distinguished American diplomat and
everything he said was the truth! As Minister to
France many years ago, he had handled with extraordinary
tact several serious political situations;
one time editor of the <i>New York Evening Post</i>, he was
also an essayist and historian. I leaned forward and
said in a voice which made no attempt to disguise
either my surprise or my pleasure, “Have I the honor
of addressing the Honorable John Bigelow?”</p>

<p>Mr. Bigelow then told me how in an off moment
he had been induced to sell, at what was then considered
a high price, but which would be a mere
trifle now, the immortal <i>Autobiography</i> of Benjamin
Franklin. He disposed of it through a New York
firm of booksellers to E. Dwight Church of Brooklyn,
and it is now in that bookman’s paradise, the library of
Mr. Henry E. Huntington, at San Marino, California.</p>

<p>Speaking of manuscripts recalls a rather pretty
story of how I unexpectedly secured an autograph
essay by a favorite modern.</p>

<p>I remember one day in London, when I was calling
upon my dear friend, H. W. Massingham, the
beloved editor of the <i>Nation</i>. His editorial offices in
Adelphi Terrace were directly beneath George Bernard
Shaw’s apartments in the same old Georgian
building. Knowing he was a good friend of Shaw, I
asked if he had any of his manuscripts. Massingham
looked at me oddly for a moment, as though<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</span>
my request had brought to his mind an entirely new
train of thought, then replied, “Oh, yes!” He ran
his hand to the bottom of an enormous waste-paper
basket under his desk; it was filled to overflowing, as
though it had not been emptied for days. He drew
out a manuscript which he had thrown away, written
in a familiar hand—Shaw’s article on the censorship
of the press! He offered it to me as a present, and
you will well understand that I accepted it eagerly.
This little story should delight Bernard Shaw himself.</p>

<p>To-day it is unfortunate that almost all manuscripts
are typed. There are, however, rare exceptions.
The late Joseph Conrad was one of the very
few authors who worked almost entirely in longhand.
When I bought the manuscript of his book, <i>Victory</i>,
at the Quinn sale in New York in 1924, I paid the
highest price—$8100—ever given at auction for
the manuscript of a living author. It was closely
written on sheets that fill two bulky cases.</p>

<p>The average writer nowadays, after he has corrected
the final draft of his work, has it copied by a
competent stenographer and then makes any further
correction on it he wishes. Many writers find it
easier to create their stories directly upon the typewriter,
while others dictate. The typewriter—what
a curse it has become to the collector! A century
from now it will be almost impossible to find the
original autograph manuscripts of writers of to-day
who stand the test of time. Who knows but that the
styles will have changed, and the machine upon which
a masterpiece was brought to life will be considered
even more precious!</p>

<p>No one knows exactly why there is hardly a scrap
left of the original manuscripts of most of the writers
of the Elizabethan period. Perhaps publishers in
those days had one fault that is prevalent to-day.
They may have been too close to their writers to be
able to appreciate the value of the original draft, or
perhaps they had scrap baskets like Massingham’s.
Of Shakespeare’s writing only six or seven signatures
are known, and these are attached to his will and
other legal documents. They are priceless, and have
been kept with great care at Somerset House and
at the Record Office in London. How unfortunate it
is that not a single line of his original work remains.
What would collectors not give now for just one page
of <i>Hamlet</i>, or even a short note in Shakespeare’s
own handwriting! Surely, $500,000 would not be
too much. Nor is there any manuscript left of either
of his noted contemporaries, Christopher Marlowe
and Robert Greene. Of these two, who opened the
way for the greatest dramatist of all time, not even
a signature remains. I was successful this year,
however, in obtaining a letter of John Fletcher, who
very probably collaborated with Shakespeare in the
writing of <i>Henry VIII.</i> Fletcher addressed this
rhymed epistle to the Countess of Huntingdon. For
years it had been in an old English muniment room
neglected and unsung; and it is really the nearest
approach to Shakespeare I have been fortunate
enough to find. When you think that hitherto not a
signature of Fletcher’s had been known, it makes this
find the more remarkable. There are, however, many
relics of his great contemporary, Ben Jonson, early
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</span>drafts of his celebrated plays, and many books are
known in which he inscribed comments and notes.</p>

<p>I have always been deeply interested in all that
remains of the literary lights of the Elizabethan era,
and especially in Edmund Spenser, another of the
great masters of Shakespeare’s magnificent day.</p>

<p>Last year, when I was crossing to England on the
Berengaria, another bookseller, truly a friendly enemy,
met me on deck one morning, and by way of greeting,
said: “Speaking of association copies, what would
you give to own a presentation copy of the first edition
of <i>The Faerie Queene</i>?”</p>

<p>“Why talk nonsense?” I replied. “It’s impossible.
It doesn’t exist.” About two weeks later an eminent
scholar who has made many great and outstanding
discoveries in early English literature called at my
hotel to see me, and invited me to go with him to inspect
his fine collection. He spoke of one book in
particular, which he was sure would interest me, but
purposely neglected to say what it was. I arrived
at his home and had hardly got beyond the front
door when he placed in my hands a volume in its
original binding of old calf. It was Spenser’s own
copy of <i>The Faerie Queene</i>, dated 1590, with an inscription
in his handwriting on the title page in
Greek: “From the author to himself.” He had also
presented this volume to Elizabeth Boyle, whom he
married four years later. On a blank page toward
the back of the book he gallantly wrote in French,
“A sa mistresse,” and under this elegant heading
had inscribed the complete first sonnet from his
glorious <i>Amoretti</i>, beginning:—</p>

<p>The <i>Amoretti</i> was not published until five years
later, in 1595.</p>

<p>As I stood looking at <i>The Faerie Queene</i> I became
quite speechless with surprise and delight, as no
other presentation copy of Spenser was known to
me. Almost before I could regain my equilibrium my
host handed me another, a smaller volume. This was
bound in old vellum, a quaint little English travel
book. With a gasp I read upon the title page a
presentation address to Gabriel Harvey, the poet’s
dearest friend, and incidentally, the bitter literary
enemy of Ben Jonson. It read: “The gift of Edmund
Spenser, clerk to the Archbishop of Rochester,
1578.” What enhanced its preciousness was that
Harvey had made notes throughout, commenting
upon his happy friendship with Spenser. After such
a startling introduction to his collection, I looked
upon my friend, this learned book lover, with even
greater admiration than before; and if he had further
offered me a presentation copy of <i>Hamlet</i> I
should not have been amazed. To-day these marvelous
mementos of the Elizabethan era are treasured
among the outstanding volumes in my library.</p>

</div>

<p>One week later my friend the American bookseller
called upon me at the Carlton Hotel in London.</p>

<p>“Hello,” I began. “You’re just the man I want to
see. I’ve found a presentation copy of <i>The Faerie
Queene</i>.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</span></p>

<p>“You unholy liar,” he said, not knowing whether
to believe me or not.</p>

<p>“Yes,” I replied; “it is at your hand.” His hands
trembled as he lifted the book from the table, and I
could see his face change color as he read the magic
lines in Spenser’s autograph.</p>

<p>An author’s manuscript will reveal just how his
work was planned and built, as well as the fluid state
of his mind at the time. Very often it reflects his
attitude toward his subject, whether he wrote meticulously,
carefully, or with assurance and ease.
The early manuscripts of great writers are curiously
alike in that they seldom show any large amount of
correction or rewriting. When these men are young
their very passion sweeps them along. But as they
grow older they develop a certain attitude of critical
acuteness which study brings, the experiences of life
itself also cause them to be less sure. Very often
they become the worst faultfinders, and tear their
work to pieces to build and rebuild glorious phrases
that later become household words. The bugaboo
of rewriting comes with the years, accompanying the
stern virtues of maturity.</p>

<p>In his later manuscripts you can almost see the
author at work, bending over his pages, writing lines,
whole paragraphs, then deleting them. These later
manuscripts of noted men and women show not only
blotted lines but entirely new readings. However, the
notable phrase in the verses prefixed to the first folio
of Shakespeare by his editors, John Heminge and
Henry Condell, dated 1623, does not apply to most
of the modern manuscripts. “And what he thought,”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</span>they wrote, “he uttered with that easiness, that
we have scarce received from him a blot on his
papers.”</p>

<p>There is also some impalpable quality in a great
man’s handwriting which draws one to it; people
who have never dreamed of collecting, who never
heard of the collecting mania, will suddenly react to
old letters and documents. They are mad to own
them. Some human attraction exists in the written
word of other years quite different from the appeal
made by printing. This appeal is primarily emotional,
rather than intellectual. Especially is this
true of autograph letters. They naturally hold a
more personal message, in that they interpret the
spirit and reflect the period of the writer, who in informal
letters is off his guard, quite unlike the mood
that an author brings to his work when he knows it
may be published. I have known people to weep
with delight at the sight of one of those charmingly
familiar letters written by Bobbie Burns. Indeed,
I once became rather dizzy with joy myself, when I
bought the Harry B. Smith Library, which included
that famous letter of Charles Dickens about the inception
of <i>Pickwick</i>, which he writes to his publishers,
Chapman and Hall. It is dated 1836, and was written
one Thursday evening from Furnival’s Inn, London.
It says:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Sirs</span>:—</p>

<p>Pickwick is at length begun in all his might and glory.
The first chapter will be ready tomorrow.</p>

no objection to doing it, I should be happy to let you have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</span>
the refusal of it. I need not say that nobody else has seen
or heard of it.</p>

<p>This great letter is now in the collection of that
famous man of affairs, fast becoming equally well
known as a bibliophile, Mr. Owen D. Young.</p>

<p>When I read Dickens’s wonderful living message,—isn’t
there a tremendous thrill in those words:
“Pickwick is at length begun in all his might and
glory,”—I never dreamed I should one day own all
that is left of the original manuscript of the master’s
greatest work, the <i>Pickwick Papers</i>. This, which
Dickens wrote when he was but twenty-four years old,
is without doubt the most valuable modern manuscript
in existence. An earlier owner, the late Mr. W. A.
White, abstracted from it a single leaf and presented
it most generously to the British Museum. What a
gracious tribute this was from an American collector!</p>

<p>When so many of the great English treasures have
come to this side of the water, how ingratiating was
so splendid a gift! There the <i>Pickwick</i> page lies, in
a glass show case, in the British Museum, and any
day one may see Dickens’s never-failing admirers
crowding in front of it to read and thrill to the
broadly penned words, now browned and a bit faded.
How rapidly the words seem to fly across the pages
of this manuscript! You can’t but feel, as you read,
that Dickens was almost divinely chosen to give to
the world a fount of humor which in its very humanity
will delight man, woman, and child throughout<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</span>
the years. All that is left of the manuscript is thirty-two
leaves, which Dickens himself arranged into two
chapters. When I read them I feel the closest union
with Dickens the author; in these pages the period
just before the coronation of Queen Victoria is made
alive and vivid to us, bridging the world of yesterday
to that of to-day.</p>

<p>The <i>Pickwick Papers</i> first appeared in serial form
in 1836, issued monthly. I think he became weary
writing them, although, heaven knows, there is
nothing in the story which would give the reader
the slightest inkling of this. But prefixed to my
manuscript is a hitherto unpublished verse. Dickens
marks it “Private and Confidential,” and it is written
for the benefit of one Mr. Hicks, as follows:—</p>

<p>At the auction sale of the library of the late
Baroness Burdett-Coutts in 1923, in London, I paid
£3700 for the manuscript of Dickens’s <i>The Haunted
Man and the Ghost’s Bargain</i>. He had given it, the
fifth and last of his series of Christmas books, to the
baroness in 1850. Ten years after <i>Pickwick</i>, Dickens
wrote this story, and the manuscript demonstrates
what I have said earlier about the painstaking and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</span>less spontaneous work of an author as he grows older.
The manuscript of <i>The Haunted Man</i> is filled with
blottings, deletions, and corrections. It is now in the
choice collection of Mr. Carl H. Pforzheimer of New
York.</p>

<p>I do not hesitate to prophesy that in time the
works of Dickens will be the most valuable after<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</span>
Shakespeare. He is one of the few English authors
whose appeal is universal. Even in translation his
works are wonderful, and they have been translated
into almost every language, keeping their peculiar
raciness, though they must sacrifice their English
idiom. Dickens will be read always, by the man in
the street as well as by the scholar.</p>

<p>Speaking of the generosity of Mr. White in presenting
the <i>Pickwick</i> leaf to the British Museum
recalls to my mind the magnificent gift of Mr. John
Gribbel of the Glenriddel Burns manuscripts to
Scotland. The great liberality displayed by this
Philadelphian should do much to cement international
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</span>relations. All the friends of Bobbie Burns in
Scotland—and they are legion—gave up hope
when these manuscripts were purchased by Mr.
Gribbel, believing them lost to the homeland forever.
You can imagine the thrill in every Scotchman’s
heart, from Sidney to Edinburgh, when the stirring
news came, hot over the cable, that they were to be
returned to their native land.</p>

SEYMOUR FOR DICKENS’S “PICKWICK PAPERS”</p>
<p class="caption">(<i>Seymour committed suicide after finishing this drawing</i>)</p>
</div>

<p>When Mr. Gribbel bought this collection in 1914,
I was naturally disappointed that I did not secure
the Glenriddel manuscripts myself. But I was as delighted
as any bra’ laddie directly descended from
the celebrated ploughboy when I learned of Mr.
Gribbel’s gift.</p>

<p>However, there are always compensations in this
game if you have the patience to wait. I recently
secured probably the greatest collection of Burns
manuscripts, the one formerly belonging to that
fine student and most charming of men, Mr. R. B.
Adam, of Buffalo, New York. I had known of this
collection all my life, but never dreamed that I
should one day own it.</p>

<p>It includes the original manuscripts of the great
poems of Burns that are enshrined in the souls of
every lover of true poetry. Perhaps the foremost is
the original draft of “Tam o’ Shanter,” written on
twelve leaves, which Burns presented to Cardonnel
Lawson in 1790. There is also the appealing “There
Was a Lass and She Was Fair”; the beautiful poem,
“The Last Time I Came O’er the Moor”; the exquisite
lyric, “To a Woodlark”; and that lovely
characteristic poem, “Wilt Thou Be My Dearie,”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</span>in which Burns himself especially delighted. Indeed,
these original drafts truly give Burns “an immortal
life in the hearts of young and old,” and when I read
and reread in the poet’s own hand Burns’s “On
Hearing a Thrush on a Morning’s Walk,” the magnificent
“Address to Edinburgh,” and the sonorous
“Lament of Mary, Queen of Scots,” I am thrilled
to the marrow.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="f50">
<img src="images/fig50.jpg" alt="burns">
<p class="caption">ORIGINAL MANUSCRIPT OF ROBERT BURNS’S POEM,<br>
“BANNOCKBURN”</p>
</div>

<p>It is difficult to describe the emotions aroused
when I read the original of that stirring battle song,
the address at Bannockburn of Robert Bruce to his
troops, which begins, “Scots, wha hae wi’ Wallace
bled.” This manuscript the poet presented to his
sister-in-law, with the inscription, “To Mrs. G.
Burns, from her brother, the author.” Burns used
to wander through Leglen Wood, supposed to be the
haunt of Wallace, and confessed having visited it
“with as much devout enthusiasm as ever a pilgrim
did the shrine of Loretto.”</p>

<p>My collection contains poems of noble sublimity and
heart-melting tenderness, such as the first poem known
to have been written by Burns, and one of his most
charming, entitled, “Once I Lov’d a Bonnie Lass.”
There are two, however, which make a terrific appeal
to me. One is the poem in which he was inspired
by the American Revolutionary War, beginning:—</p>


<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">No Spartan tube, no Attic shell,</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">No lyre Eolian I awake,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">’Tis Liberty’s bold note I swell,</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">Thy harp, Columbia, let me take.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>


<p>The other is in some respects the favorite one of all
lovers of Burns, the magnificent “For a’ That and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</span>
a’ That.” I keep this collection and the poet’s priceless
letters under lock and key in my vault in New
York, lest the whole Scottish nation awaken one day,
rise up, and demand them.</p>

<p>It is sad that Burns received very little money
for his poems when he was alive. How surprised he
must be, and with what irony must he observe, if his
spirit walks this way, the great sums which have
passed from one hand to another in the exciting exchange
of his manuscripts.</p>

<p>Our own Mark Twain always wrote under the
greatest pressure. Like many other artists, he was
in constant need of money, but unlike them, he held
to a remarkably consistent gait in his writing. His
manuscripts are unusual, they show but few changes
and corrections. His stories came as “trippingly on
the tongue” as his vital conversation, which was
characteristically free and easy. I have the original
manuscripts of <i>Tom Sawyer Abroad</i>, <i>Pudd’nhead
Wilson</i>, and <i>A Connecticut Yankee at King Arthur’s
Court</i>. The second was written by the author under
the title of “Those Extraordinary Twins,” and the
last one was originally called “The Stranger’s Tale.”
The few corrections made by Mark Twain do not
seem especially happy ones to our modern eyes. In
my opinion it would have been better if he had left
alone the thoughts which God first gave him. There
are whole scathing paragraphs in <i>A Connecticut
Yankee</i> which were never published, but should be
published.</p>

<p>Lovers of manuscripts all succumb to the magic
beauty of those of Edgar Allan Poe. Most of them
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</span>were written on long folio sheets in an exquisite and
unaffected hand. So perfect and so fine is the rise
and fall of the pen that his writing seems an imitation
of copperplate in its evenness. I had an amusing
experience, many years ago, after I bought one of the
three known autograph copies of Poe’s poem, “Annabel
Lee.” A dealer in Boston wrote to me, asking
if I could come there to view this most interesting
Poe manuscript. I made the appointment, arriving
on an early morning train. When I reached the
dealer’s shop he said he would not have the manuscript
to show me until one o’clock. I decided to pass
the time walking, to think out clearly just what I
should pay him for it when the question of price
came up.</p>

<p>As I wandered about the city I thought $1000
would be about right; I then imagined that this copy
must be an especially beautiful one, and decided
that $2000 was a fairer figure. But the more I considered
it the more I coveted it, so I jumped to
$3000, then $4000, and finally made $5000 my limit.
When I returned to the shop he showed me a truly
lovely autograph. I asked him what he wanted for
it. He replied he would take $500, plus a ten per
cent commission! It seemed preposterous to me, but
I was so pleased I paid quickly, took the manuscript
and returned to New York.</p>

<p>Some time later I went West with several very
fine first editions. I also took the manuscript of
“Annabel Lee.” The train rushed through the night
and I found it difficult to sleep. This time I considered
what price I should ask for this manuscript,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</span>
and the sum a customer would pay for it. When the
train reached Harrisburg I thought $1000 would be
a very nice price, giving me a profit of about one
hundred per cent. At Pittsburgh, thinking of the
beauty of the poem, I ran my price up to $2000.
Then I fell asleep. A jerky stop woke me at Fort
Wayne, and immediately the Poe manuscript came
to my mind. In the narrow confines of a Pullman
berth I felt sure it was worth $3000. After all, what
I had paid for it should be left out of the question,
for it was a magnificent lyric, one of the finest productions
of his genius. At last I reached Chicago,
and up it went again, this time to $4000.</p>

<p>My customer lived in a suburb, and by the time
I had reached his home I knew I could not part with
“Annabel Lee” for less than $5000! This was the
price I had been willing myself to pay for it. After
selling him some very attractive books I showed him
the “Annabel Lee.” His eyes glistened; he asked
me the price. I bravely said, “Five thousand
dollars.” He jumped at it quickly, just as I had at the
$500 in Boston several months before. I was awfully
amused, and told him about my journey and the
workings of my mind; about my original purchase of
the manuscript and the sum I had given for it, and
how the price had progressed geographically.</p>

<p>He burst out laughing, took hold of my arm, and
said, “I suppose I have something to be grateful for,
at that! Thank God, I don’t live in San Francisco!”</p>

<p>What would this manuscript be worth to-day?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</span></p>

<p>This precious draft is now happily in the library of
a collector whose taste is exquisite and faultless.
The author has prefixed to the story a letter to the
editor of the <i>New England Magazine</i>. Poe writes in
part:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I send you an original tale in hope of your accepting it
for the N. E. Magazine. It is one of a number of similar
pieces which I have contemplated publishing under the
title “Eleven Tales of the Arabesque.” They are supposed
to be read by the eleven members of a literary club,
and are followed by the remarks of the company upon
each.</p>
</div>

<p>This manuscript, too, is beautifully, clearly written,
except that the letters are very small. It was not
until some time after I bought it that I discovered
one of the most tragic sentences I have ever read.
Poe had folded over his manuscript several times.
There are three tiny words inscribed in the lower
left corner. One of the greatest masters of all time
appeals to his editor, saying desperately, “I am poor.”
These few pathetic words are enough to tear at the
heartstrings of any collector.</p>

<p>A deadly malady which attacks all collectors at
one stage or another is catalogitis. Here is a disease
which will defy science as long as books and their
ilk remain to be collected. In the beginning the
symptoms are not grave. You will quietly open your
mail one morning to find a pamphlet, perhaps from
some local auctioneer, enumerating certain books he
is offering for sale. From time to time other sales
lists will be sent you, and one day when you have
started to arrange your desk neatly you will be surprised<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</span>
that there are catalogues in nearly every
drawer. You quickly decide to throw them out.
But something, the most insidious germ of the disease,
stays your hand. You have fallen a victim,
merely in keeping them.</p>

<p>Then follows what Leigh Hunt, more than half a
century ago, called “one of the loftiest pleasures of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</span>
the imagination,” hours spent with a pencil in hand
and catalogues scattered about, as you read over,
memorize, and check up the names of books and
manuscripts you would like to buy if you could
afford it—and sometimes do anyway. Catalogitis
is never a waste of time. Collectors are rewarded
sooner or later by an intensive study, especially of
new catalogues hot from the bookseller. It is a great
point of vantage to secure an advance copy, thus
being in a position to forestall one’s fellow collectors.
For years I have been desperately ill with catalogitis.
Indeed, I am a hopeless case. I have reached a peculiar
stage. I even order my overcoats made with an
extra and unusually large pocket. A sort of literary
marsupial, I carry my young—and old—catalogues
in my pouch, never sure into what they may
develop, as I bound from sale to sale.</p>

<p>I shall never forget the time when an English book
dealer mailed me a catalogue which brought me luck
immediately. Quite daft at the sight of it, I studied
every item mentioned, then my eyes fell upon the
description of a Benedict Arnold letter. According to
the catalogue, this was the letter in which Arnold
gave for the first time a truthful account of his treason,
mentioning the £6000—less than $30,000—paid
to him by the British. The letter was listed at only
thirty pounds. I quickly cabled my brother Philip,
who has a remarkable and unerring taste for fine
things. He was in London at the time and was fortunate
enough to secure it for me.</p>

<p>Arnold wrote rather complainingly to Lord North,
the English prime minister, as follows:—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Your Memoralist, Influenced by Sentiments of Loyalty
to the King and Attachment to the British Constitution,
has sacrificed a handsome property in America ... and
at the most Eminent hazard of his Life, Co-operated with
Sir Henry Clinton, Commander in Chief of the British
Army in America, which will appear by his official letters
to Lord Sackville. But his Intentions and measures being
discovered before they would be brought to a happy
issue, which bid fair to put a fortunate end to the War in
America. He was obliged to fly, and very narrowly, but
fortunately, escaped from the Americans, and having
joined the British Army in New York, the Commander
in Chief was pleased to confer upon him the Rank of
Brigadier General, which was approved by the King....
And your Memoralist begs leave further to observe that
in Consideration of his Corps and Services, he has received
from Government only six thousand pounds sterling, one
thousand pounds of which he has expended in raising his
Regiment.</p>

<p>Your Memoralist has not only sacrificed his fortune,
but is deprived of Four Hundred and Fifty pounds sterling
per Annum, which he was intitled to receive from
Congress, as also a large tract of land, and by the decided
part which he has taken, his Family have been Banished
from America, and he has sacrificed his prospects for providing
for them there, which were undoubtedly of equal
if not of greater Importance to them than his Fortune,
which with that of others has been given up by the late
Administration for the desirable purpose of obtaining
Peace.</p>
</div>

<p>The next day the London dealer received seventeen
cabled offers for it. When Mr. Henry F. DePuy
came into my library in New York soon after, I told
him the story of the Benedict Arnold letter. One of
the most generous of men, he asked me to place a
price on it. I replied frankly that the price I paid<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</span>
for it was nothing short of ridiculous good fortune,
that I believed if it were sold at auction in this country
it would bring at least $1850. He offered to buy
it from me at that figure, and we immediately closed
the bargain. Three years later, when Mr. DePuy
held his sale, I was pleased to see my judgment verified.
The Benedict Arnold letter sold for $2850. It
is now in the Huntington collection.</p>

<p>If you once make a find like this you become
wedded to the reading of catalogues. The finest
private collection of catalogues in the world is in
Paris. It is the result of the tireless and exhaustive
study of my friend Seymour de Ricci. He has gathered
complete files of auction catalogues dating from
the seventeenth century, from France, Germany,
and England. Every room of his large apartment on
the Rue Boissière is filled from floor to ceiling. He
has even compiled a catalogue of catalogues. This
stupendous work comprises more than forty thousand
items. Commercial pamphlets are generally
thrown into the wastebasket, but I doubt if book
catalogues are ever thrown away. True collectors
guard them as zealously as they do their rarest
literary finds. I like to look back at some of the catalogues
I have issued, and note the marked increase
of price since certain items have left my hands.
How I would like to buy back many books and
manuscripts at the prices I sold them for!</p>

OF OMAR KHAYYÁM” BY EDWARD FITZGERALD</p>
</div>

<p>This purchase of the Benedict Arnold letter was
the beginning of a mad chase for American documents
and historical papers which has become more frantic
with the roll of years. Although great papers dealing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</span>
with the history of England have always interested
me intensely, those of American interest are
dearest to my heart. It is a great and exciting adventure
to collect noble relics of our country’s past.
The chase is often more fascinating than the wildest
exploits of the most experienced huntsman; sometimes
the bag proves remarkable, far beyond one’s
hopes and expectations. When I first started to
collect Americana it did not enjoy its present vogue.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</span>
In the early days you could buy amazingly important
historical papers for a mere song. Nowadays
everyone is seeking things American, from
old New England bedsteads to Pennsylvania whiskey
flasks. The spell seems to be on the nation,
and this craving for Americana is extending to
every collector.</p>

<p>The greatest purchase I ever made was an original
certified copy of the Declaration of Independence.
It is the only official copy extant, with the exception
of that famous instrument now deposited for safekeeping
in the Library of Congress. It was in 1911,
when I was attending an afternoon session of the
remarkable sale of the Robert Hoe collection in
New York. In the midst of the bidding an attendant
entered the room saying I was wanted at the telephone.
It was my brother calling from Philadelphia,
and his voice sounded so excited that I feared he
had ill news for me.</p>

<p>A cable had just come from Berlin, he said, offering
us this certified copy of the Declaration of Independence.
It was the one sent to Frederick the
Great, King of Prussia, in order that the independence
of the American colonies should be recognized
officially in that part of the world. It was signed
by Benjamin Franklin and Silas Deane, Commissioners
Plenipotentiary. Included in the lot was the
only signed and attested copy of the original Articles
of Confederation of the United States, the first provisional
government of the colonies. I, too, was
tremendously impressed, and my only question was:
Were they authentic? In reply my brother told me<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</span>
they were to be sold by a direct descendant of Baron
von Scolenberg, the minister of Frederick the Great,
and that their authenticity was undisputed.</p>

<p>Although the price was high, we felt that we could
not allow manuscripts of such tremendous national
importance to escape us. Then my brother, with his
usual business acumen, immediately cabled our agent
to pay the money forthwith. Our excitement was
intense until we received a reply confirming our purchase.
Neither my brother nor I could sleep until
the news was flashed over the wires the next morning.
We did not realize the extent of our good fortune,
however, until one of our competitors informed us
he had sent a special messenger from London to
Berlin to secure this great document. His disappointment
was terrific when he learned that these
precious papers had already been sold.</p>

<p>I do not think the price of $260,000 excessive for
these great cornerstones of our country’s history.
Some day they will be beyond the computation
of dollars. What adds a further glamour to this tale
is that only a few days later someone came to our
office and offered us the original letter arranging for
the transfer of Independence Hall from the State of
Pennsylvania to the City of Philadelphia. The transfer
of ground was for the historic building and the
piece of land known as Independence Square, on
which was erected the clock tower that then contained
the most precious memento of our independence,
the famous Liberty Bell. It gives the
purchase price of this most hallowed building and
ground at only $70,000.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</span></p>

<p>When I think of the historic papers and documents,
and the great literary manuscripts that have passed
through my hands into those of our customers, I recall
the words from Proverbs xx, 14, which is the motto
of our house:—</p>

<p>“It is naught, it is naught, saith the buyer; but
when he hath gone his way, then he boasteth.”</p>

<p class="c large sp">AMERICAN CHILDREN’S BOOKS</p>


<p><span class="smcap large">A young</span> man who recently came into my library in
New York looked about at the high walls entirely
lined with rare books, then sank into a chair. He
was the very picture of dejection. For a moment he
sat quietly staring into space, then said, with a melancholy
sigh, “It’s no use!”</p>

<p>“What’s the matter?” I inquired. “Bad news?”</p>

<p>“No!” He turned upon me with a quick blaze of
temper. “How can anyone collect books after seeing
all these rarities?” He waved in accusatory circles
toward the walls. “I have very little money. Why,
I can’t even begin to collect!”</p>

<p>Now this was really a very nice young man. He
was in his early twenties, loved books, and had brains
too. Then what was the matter with him? Alas, he
had very little money and very, very little imagination.
He was minus the latter asset, the very foundation
of successful book collecting. He allowed
himself to be blinded by the high prices of a few old
volumes. He either could not, or would not, visualize
anything beyond that which he actually saw before
him. He had no vision.</p>

<p>People do not always have to invest in high-priced
books to form an interesting collection. Many unusual
collections have been made through small but
exceedingly careful and, of course, thoughtful expenditure.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</span>
Yet this is a fact very difficult to thump
into the young collector’s head. It has taken some
men I know—men with slender purses—several
years to realize this. Meanwhile they lose both time
and bargains. But vision in book buying does not
come so readily when you are first suffering from the
febrile mania of collecting. Yet be not dismayed!
Just because Gutenberg Bibles and Shakespeare
folios jolt the auction rooms with their stupendous
prices is no reason why you should ignore the works
of a comparatively obscure writer who appeals to
you, someone in whom you believe.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</span></p>

<p>Keep your eyes on his books, his manuscripts, his
letters, when you are browsing in bookshops; ask
yourself a few leading questions concerning his future
and answer them honestly. Do you believe your
author has an intrinsic value that is likely to increase
with the years? How scarce are these books or manuscripts
or letters of his? Think back. If you have
the real collecting instinct you have kept all your
sales catalogues. Check them over.</p>

<p>Just remember that Thomas Hardy, Rudyard
Kipling, and Joseph Conrad first editions could have
been bought a few years ago for almost nothing, in
fact at their published prices.</p>

<p>This reminds me of a remarkable prophecy made
by Uncle Moses in 1895. He was complaining of the
high prices he had just paid for several books. He
said he didn’t see how rare volumes could possibly
go any higher. Then he amended this by naming
three men in English letters whose works he thought
would advance to almost unbelievable values—Shelley,
Keats, and Poe. If only I had taken advantage
of Uncle Moses’ significant foresight and
vision!</p>

<p>“When prices are high,” Uncle Moses advised me,
“don’t forget that there are new fields for the collector.
There’s no need to grumble. You can always
spend your money wisely on the things which are not
so much in demand.”</p>

<p>I realized, even then, that these were words of wisdom
in the book game. Many times I have thought
of his oft-repeated, laconic statement: “There are
always books to fit every purse.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</span></p>

<p>There are hundreds of types of books to collect:
volumes as yet unnoticed in the auction room, which
lie neglected year in, year out, upon the bookseller’s
shelf, and which are disregarded by the conventional
collector. They are waiting for the man with imagination
to discover them. And many of them will
eventually come into their own. My uncle and
others of his day could not foresee the slavish manner
in which some collectors would in later years pursue,
with neither rhyme nor reason, every volume on any
arbitrary list. Imagine buying books other than those
of your own taste and inclination! It seems the
veriest joke to have signposts on the way, indicating
the books you should buy—just as though one or
two men are able to choose fifty or even one hundred
of the most outstanding books in English or any
other literature. The difference of opinion is too
great. To me such buying is about as thrilling as
going to a doctor to have him dictate your diet.</p>

<p>“I have collected,” said my uncle, as we talked
together a few years before he died, “along a path
untrodden in my day—early American children’s
books.” He walked about his dusty old shop for a
few moments, then selected a diminutive volume,
the <i>Dying Sayings of Hannah Hill, Junior</i>, published
in Philadelphia in 1717. “Now,” he observed,
“I will show you an example. I would have you
know that this little book is damn rare.” He always
hated and made fun of the stereotyped expressions
in booksellers’ catalogues, such as “excessively rare,”
“extremely rare,” “of utmost rarity,” “very rare,”
and “rare.” He said it reminded him of the man<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</span>
who had eggs to sell, offering them as newly laid
eggs, fresh eggs, and eggs. Uncle Moses described
his books more colorfully. First of all they were “infernally
rare,” then “damn, damn rare,” followed
by “damn rare,” and finally “rare.”</p>

<p>This and similar picturesque language fitted his
rugged personality and endeared him to everyone.
How much more interesting it would be if modern
cataloguers used their imagination when describing
the degree of rarity of an old book.</p>

<p>In his younger days Uncle Moses had had a most
unusual opportunity to gather together many early
books published expressly for children. When he
succeeded to the business of the Philadelphia publishers,
McCarthy and Davis, in 1851, the stock
included a number of early American juveniles. You
see, McCarthy and Davis were successors to Johnson
and Warner, who succeeded the original firm established
by Jacob Johnson in 1780. It was noted for its
children’s books, so you can imagine the varied
juvenile curiosities my uncle inherited.</p>

<p>Even when my brothers and sisters and I were
very small children, Uncle Moses remembered our
birthdays and other anniversaries always with a
pretty little book. Although we were all taught to
care for and really honor our books from the time
we could hold them in our hands, it was to my eldest
sister, Rebecca, and to me that he gave the most
valuable and entertaining volumes. I have kept
every one of them; each bears his inscription in
beautiful, finely printed letters, “From Uncle Mo.”</p>

<p>My sister was early imbued with the book-hunting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</span>
spirit, and I have often found her in some little
secondhand store in Philadelphia quietly looking
through piles of books in the hope of securing something
quaint, something unusual and perhaps hitherto
unknown. Her searches were not fruitless either.</p>

<p>These book-hunting expeditions were adventures
for us. We thought it great fun to add to our little
library so charming and tiny a pamphlet as, for instance,
<i>The History of Ann Lively and her Bible</i>,
which was sold in 1830 for one half cent, and issued
in New York in a somewhat proselyting manner by
the American Tract Society. It was a red-letter day
in our lives if we could find some curious example to
flaunt before the amused face of Uncle Moses. But
the occasion was rare, indeed, when we found a book
which he did not already own.</p>

<p>It was many years ago that I took Uncle Moses’
tip to start collecting early American children’s books.
Hence I am some leagues ahead of those who got a
later start. Many collectors are only now beginning
to rub their eyes and to wake up to the fascination
which these tiny volumes offer to book lovers. Early
American juveniles are unusually interesting for
several reasons. To begin with, they give such naïve
samples of the mental food our poor ancestors lived
upon in the dim days of their childhood.</p>

<p>Take, for instance, a small volume published in
1738 by Samuel Phillips, called <i>History of Our Lord
and Savior, Jesus Christ, Epitomized; for the Use of
Children in the South Parish at Andover</i>. The author
says that “his great Lord and Master had commanded
his Ministers to feed his Lambs as well as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</span>
his Sheep.” But what anæmic feeding! He sets
before his particular lambs sixty pages of the most
indigestible food ever concocted, consisting of questions
on and answers to the most abstruse metaphysical,
philosophical, and controversial subjects!
Subjects which are no nearer solution to-day than
when the Rev. Samuel Phillips propounded them for
the benefit of his bewildered little lambs of Andover
Parish one hundred and eighty-nine years ago!</p>

<p>You will find early American children’s books
difficult to obtain. There are but few left in good
condition to-day, but it is great fun tracking them.
In the first place, very few were published by our
Colonial presses. Such venerable gentlemen as Cotton
Mather and Governor Winthrop kept the printers
too busily occupied issuing theological works or acts
of provincial assemblies; too seriously engaged with
statutes, laws, almanacs, prayer books, catechisms,
and sermons, to print many books for children. Lost
in a theological web of their own weaving, the leaders
of the day cared little about the intellectual amusement
of their girls and boys.</p>

<p>But most of the young book fanciers, lucky enough
to obtain the few books issued, mauled them about
or destroyed them entirely. They are generally found
with torn and missing leaves—these charming atrocities
have made many copies quite worthless to the
collector. I have been told that it is but normal for
a bouncing bibliophile of twelve months to teethe
on the hard board corners of, for instance, a copy of
<i>Cinderella</i>. Indeed, a young child’s attitude toward
a book is not unlike that of a cannibal toward a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</span>
missionary. Very young children—this is on record,
if you doubt me—have been known to eat their
books, literally devouring their contents.</p>

<p>When I was about seven years old another little
boy of the same age came from a suburb of Philadelphia
to spend the day with me. We quickly struck
up a friendship. Although it was raining and we
were forced to remain indoors, we played together
quite happily. Everything went smoothly until late
in the afternoon, when our inventive faculties began
to give out. It was then, after we had taken apart
most of my toys, that my little friend’s eyes lighted
upon my books. I watched him cross the room to
the low shelf which held them so neatly, and I remained
quiet even as he began to paw them over.
But when I saw him take a pencil from his pocket to
write crude letters of the alphabet along the margins,
I flew at him like a wildcat. Only the immediate intervention
of our combined families saved him from
annihilation. We have met many times since, and
we always laugh at the story of my juvenile wrath.</p>

<p>He still insists, after forty years, that his was a
perfectly normal action in a child. I believed in
treating a book as something sacred, even at that
age. The germ had evidently entered my system
with my first vaccination!</p>

<p>In 1902 my uncle gave me his wonderful collection
of children’s books.</p>

<p>Among them was his “damn rare” pamphlet, <i>A
Legacy for Children, being Some of the Last Expressions
and Dying Sayings of Hannah Hill, Junr. Of the
City of Philadelphia in the Province of Pennsylvania,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</span>
in America, Aged Eleven Years and near Three Months</i>,
which was printed by Andrew Bradford, at the sign
of the Bible, in Philadelphia, in 1717. Little Hannah
took several days to die, and she insisted upon having
the undivided attention of every member of her
family. She gave them moral advice, told them
what they should do and what they should not do
after she had departed. “The Council which she
gave, to her Dear and only Sister and Cousin Loyd
Zachary, whom she dearly loved, was very grave and
pithy....”</p>

<p>To-day I have nearly eight hundred volumes,
which date from 1682 to 1840. They reveal with
amazing fidelity the change in juvenile reading
matter, the change, too, in the outward character of
the American child. They depict the slow but determined
growth from the child of Puritan New
England to that of our own day. It is a delightful
change from <i>Virtuous William the Obedient Prentice</i>,
and <i>Patty Primrose</i>, to <i>Tom Sawyer</i>, <i>Huck Finn</i>,
<i>Penrod</i>, and <i>Winnie-the-pooh</i>. If Robert Louis
Stevenson had had the temerity to publish <i>Treasure
Island</i> in the good old days of Governor Winthrop
he would have been a fit subject for the common
hangman! I do not mean to imply that the New
England boy of the seventeenth century was the
goody-goody thing which his parents tried to make
him. If he was choked with the Bible and threatened
with the catechism and the prayer book, if the
creed and Bunyan were ruthlessly thrust down his
innocent young throat, he nevertheless could think
of Captain Kidd, Sir Henry Morgan, the Indians,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</span>
and the whole machinery of the boyhood imagination.
Free thought was permitted him because there was
no way to suppress it.</p>

<p>The little Puritans! My heart aches for them
when I read an example such as <i>The Rule of the New-Creature.
To be Practiced every day in all the Particulars
of which are Ten</i>. This is the earliest book
in my collection. It was published in Boston for
Mary Avery, who sold books near the Blue Anchor,
1682. Imagine the weary little child who had to
listen throughout a long Sunday afternoon to the
contents of a book which started off in this manner:—</p>

<p>“Be sensible of thy Original Corruption daily, how
it inclines thee to evil, and indisposeth thee to good;
groan under it, and bewail it as Paul did.... Also
take special notice of your actual sins, or daily infirmities,
in Thought, Word, Deed. Endeavor to
make your peace with God for them before you go to
bed.”</p>

<p>There is, too, one of the most famous of all juveniles,
the equally inspiriting and nourishing <i>Spiritual
Milk for Boston Babes. In either England: Drawn
out of the breasts of both Testaments for their Souls
nourishment. But may be of like use to any Children.
Printed at Boston, 1684</i>. My copy is the only one
known of this date. John Cotton, the great and influential
Puritan minister, had written this many
years before, and it was first published in England
in 1646, to settle a growing dissension among the
Puritans, who could not decide which catechism of
the many then in use was best for their children.
This volume grew very popular and from it the little
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</span>ones learned to die with much grace, and, therefore,
eternal glory. Yet it was found very difficult to
teach the young of New England the proper way to
die; of all knowledge it is the most difficult to impart,
as there are no really good textbooks.</p>

<p>The ecstasy over the departure of a pure young
child is one of the most remarkable manifestations
of the Puritan spirit. No book shows this more
clearly than the Rev. James Janeway’s <i>A Token for
Children, being an Exact Account of the Conversion,
Holy and Exemplary Lives and Joyous Deaths of
several Young Children</i>. This book passed through
edition after edition in England and her colonies,
and was the certain means of saving many children
from hell and damnation. My copy is the only one
extant from Benjamin Franklin’s press, and is dated
1749. Janeway states in his Preface, which is addressed
“to all Parents, School Masters and School
Mistresses or any who have any Hand in the Education
of Children:—</p>

<p>“Remember the Devil is at work hard, wicked
Ones are industrious, and corrupt Nature is a rugged,
knotty Piece to hew. But be not discouraged.”</p>

<p>The author then goes on to relate the wicked
bringing into this world of little children, and dwells
lovingly and tenderly upon their wise and glorious
deaths at the age of six or seven or even ten years.
An early death in purity and virtue was a thing to
be coveted and desired, and Janeway requests in his
Preface that the teacher should impress upon the
little ones the advisability of imitating the early
demise of these sweet children whose short and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</span>
devout lives are narrated by him. Cotton Mather,
who wrote a continuation of Janeway, and described
the brilliant, joyous, matchless deaths of New England
children—Janeway described the demise of
the children of Old England—died at the age of
sixty-five years, thus prudently neglecting to follow
the example of his beautiful and obedient pupils who
passed away, in all holiness, at the hoary age of six.
We shall select a passage from the celebrated little
book, which bears this title:—</p>

<p><i>A Token for the Children of New England, or some
Examples of Children, in whom the Fear of God was
remarkably budding before they died; in several parts of
New England. Preserved and Published for the Encouragement
of Piety in other children.</i></p>

<p>The selected passage is as follows:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Elizabeth Butcher, Daughter of Alvin and Elizabeth
Butcher, of Boston, was born July 14th, 1709. When
she was about Two Years and half Old; as she lay in the
Cradle she would ask her self that Question, What is my
corrupt Nature? and would make answer again to herself,
It is empty of Grace, bent unto Sin, and only to Sin,
and that continually. She took great delight in learning
her Catechism, and would not willingly go to Bed without
saying some Part of it.</p>

<p>She being a weakly Child, her Mother carried her into
the Country for Health; And when she was about Three
Years old, and at Meeting, she would set with her Eyes
fix’d on the Minister, to the Admiration of all that Sat
about her, who said that grown up People might learn
and take Example of her. She took great Delight in reading,
and was ready and willing to receive Instruction.</p>

<p>She was not contented with the bare reading of God’s
Word, but would frequently ask the meaning of it. And<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</span>
when she was at her work, she would often ask where
such and such Places in Scripture were, and would mention
the Words that she might be directed to find them.</p>

<p>It was her Practice to carry her Catechism or some
other good Book to Bed with her, and in the Morning
she would be sitting up in her Bed reading before any of
the Family were awake.</p>
</div>

<p>Such goodness could not last, and on the thirteenth
of June, 1718, poor little Elizabeth departed this
life, “being eight years and just eleven months old.”</p>

<p>It is related of another child, Daniel Bradley, the
son of Nathan and Hester Bradley of Guilford,
Connecticut, that when the said child was about three
years old, “he had one Night an Impression of the Fears
of Death, which put him into Crying; his Mother
told him, if he died he would go to Heaven; unto
which he replied, He knew not how he would like that
Place, where he would be acquainted with no body!”</p>

<p>It is curious how you run unexpectedly upon
things which you have long desired. I always wanted
a copy of George Fox’s <i>Instructions for Right Spelling</i>,
printed by Reinier Jansen, in Philadelphia, in 1702.
One day I stopped at Travers’s Bookshop in Trenton,
New Jersey. Now Clayton L. Travers is a true bookman;
he knows the business thoroughly. In fact he
was an old crony of my uncle. I said to him that I
had been looking several years for Fox’s book. When
I told him the title, he thought for a moment, then
disappeared to the back of the shop. Two minutes
later he returned with a little volume which was in an
old sheep binding, the title page decorated with an
elaborate woodcut border. I opened it and read the
great Friend’s simple description of a comma:—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</span></p>

<p>“Comma,” wrote George Fox, “is a little stop or
breathing; as Behold O Lord.” Please note that he
placed no comma after Behold! The discovery of
Fox’s old spelling book was a delight to me, but what
made it still more pleasant was Travers’s generosity
in letting me have it for about one quarter its worth.
Collector’s luck!</p>

<p>“They be darned small, but the flavor am delicious,”
said an old Southerner to me of the quail in
his part of the country. The same can also be applied
to these children’s books. I suppose many people
will wonder why I, an old bachelor, prefer them? I
can only answer with another question. Why is it
that old bachelors also write the best children’s
stories? There is no answer. But, thank heaven, I
am not alone in my crime. Another confirmed
bachelor, a dear friend of mine, is quite as enthusiastic
on this youthful theme. Dr. Wilberforce
Eames, of New York, one of the greatest students of
books this country ever had, abets me; especially
when he casually informs me of the probable whereabouts
of some rarity that I have been seeking for
years.</p>

<p>Another bookman, my genial colleague, Mr.
Lathrop C. Harper, also of New York, and a great
specialist in Americana, has been as much interested
in these little books as I myself. Instead of selling
them to me, Mr. Harper gives me all the tiny juveniles
that he can find. He has just presented to me a
little book published in Boston in 1714, which contains
embedded in a waste of theological discussion
for infants, the following priceless gem:—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</span></p>

<p>“O Children of New England, Poor Hearts; You
are going to Hell indeed: But will it not be a dreadful
thing to go to Hell from New England?”</p>

</p></div>


<p>Mr. Eames, with generosity equaling Mr. Harper’s,
has filled many of the crevices of my collection with
the most interesting gifts. I can’t say that I altogether
approve of the generous impulses of these two
gentlemen—except when it applies to myself! It
is very bad for the book business. If bookmen were
encouraged to go about giving away their precious
finds, what would we poor booksellers do?</p>

<p>This reminds me of the long chase I had for
<i>Heavenly Spirits for Youthful Minds</i> some time ago.
A customer in Yonkers wrote to me saying he had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</span>
this very rare book, supposed to have been issued by
an old Kentucky press in 1800. I was very keen to
see it, so I motored to his home at my first opportunity.
When I arrived he pointed toward the
shelves at one end of his library. I saw with delight
and envy the long-sought volume, but when I took
hold of it I was chilled. It felt decidedly clammy.
Then, as my friend burst out laughing, I realized it
was a porcelain jug made in the exact shape of a
book! The joke was on me.</p>

<p>My disappointment was not too great, however,
as the <i>Heavenly Spirits</i> was filled with mundane
ones—Old Crow whiskey. I accepted it as gracefully
as I could, but I no longer use this imitation
volume for whiskey—I want something larger. Nor
would I want to fill it from the <i>Glass of Whiskey</i>, a
tract published for youthful minds in Philadelphia
in 1830. This tiny yellow-covered pamphlet is but
two inches square. The artist who drew the illustrations
indicated, with his picture of a bunch of
grapes beneath the title, that he knew little or nothing
of the inspirational sources of whiskey. Perhaps
his innocence secured him the job. Small boys freely
imbibing, and the resultant fruits thereof, are
neatly portrayed. With what fascination and horror
little children must have read:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>There is a bottle. It has something in it which is called
Whiskey. Little reader, I hope you will never taste any
as long as you live. It is a poison. So is brandy, so is
rum, so is gin, and many other drinks. They are called
strong drink. They are so strong that they knock people
down and kill them. They are sometimes called ardent<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</span>
spirits, that is burning spirits. They burn up those who
drink them.</p>
</div>

<p>The appropriate ending must have sent many a tot
in search of a pencil to sign the pledge: “O, how
shall I keep from being a drunkard? I will tell you.
<i>Never drink a drop of anything that makes people
drunk.</i>”</p>

<p>I made my first find in children’s books when I
was but a child myself. A playmate of mine had an
aunt who lived on Broad Street in Philadelphia. We
passed her house daily, on the way to and from
school. Sometimes we were invited to stop for lunch.
One day I happened to notice a pile of small books
on her sitting-room table. She said she kept them
there to amuse the younger children of her family.
Although she knew I came from bookish people, she
seemed surprised that I, a boy of twelve, should be
interested in old volumes. As I could hardly put
them down, she was evidently impressed; she offered
them to me. You may well believe that I took them
and rushed out of the house, lest she change her
mind. When I reached home and my uncle saw
what I had been lucky enough to receive, he exclaimed
at their rarity. My treasure trove comprised
three wonderful little volumes. They were <i>Black
Giles</i>, <i>The Cries of Philadelphia</i>, and a rare edition of
<i>Babes in the Wood</i>.</p>

<p>For thirty years I tried to obtain Benjamin Franklin’s
<i>The Story of a Whistle</i>. “<i>Le grand</i> Franklin,”
as they called him abroad, wrote and published this
fascinating story in 1779, when he had his press at
Passy, just outside of Paris. He had printed it in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</span>
French and in English, on opposite pages, in a charming
pamphlet which he presented to his friends. He
used the little Passy press mainly to run off official
documents and other matters connected with his
mission as the American Minister to the Court of
France. In 1923, I bought one of the two copies that
have survived, at an auction sale in London. It had
been briefly catalogued—lucky for me!—as A
printed sheet in French and English, “On Paying
too much for a Whistle.” Although I would have
gladly paid £1000 for it, it was knocked down to me
for less than one tenth of this sum.</p>

<p>When discussing printing in this country, it is
impossible not to refer to Benjamin Franklin. He
originated almost everything original in America.
His projects are more talked about to-day than when
he lived. Franklin, as a child in Boston, had had a
taste of the dull literary offering of the Pilgrim
Fathers. The <i>New England Primer</i> was then the
best seller. When he became a printer he published
edition after edition of it. Although Franklin himself
records the sale of 37,100 of these primers, there
is but one copy known to exist to-day. Mr. William
S. Mason, of Evanston, Illinois, is the owner of this
unique copy. Surely, in some New England attic
there must be another. The collector can but hope!
I have the only one known printed by his successor,
David Hall—shall I ever obtain one from Benjamin’s
own press?</p>

<p>In 1749 Franklin wrote and published <i>Proposals
Relating to the Education of Youth in Pensilvania</i>.
This work greatly interests me and all those who<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</span>
claim the University of Pennsylvania as their Alma
Mater. It was soon after Franklin issued this that
he and twenty-three other citizens of Philadelphia
banded together as an association which soon completed
plans to establish an academy for young men.
It opened in 1751. So this little book is a part of the
actual foundation of the University of Pennsylvania.
When he was an old man, eighty-two, to be exact,
Franklin was still keenly interested in new books for
children. He had already given his favorite grandson,
Benjamin Franklin Bache, a fine printing press
with types, and set him up as a printer. Under the
guidance of his celebrated grandfather, young Bache
printed <i>Lessons for Children from Two to Five Years
Old</i>.</p>

<p>The older man was so delighted with his efforts
that he decided, with a business acumen not diminished
with the years, to market the books for him.
Believing Boston to be a good commercial outlet, he
wrote, on November 26, 1788, to his nephew Jonathan
Williams:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Loving Cousin</span>:—</p>

<p>I have lately set up one of my grandchildren, Benja.
F. Bache, as a Printer here, and he has printed some very
pretty little books for children. By the sloop Friendship,
Capt. Stutson, I have sent a Box address’d to you, containing
150 of each volume, in Sheets, which I request
you would, according to your wonted goodness, put in a
way of being dispos’d of for the Benefit of my dear Sister.
They are sold here, bound in marbled Paper at 1 s. a
volume; but I should suppose it best, if it may be done,
to Sell the whole to some Stationer, at once, unbound as
they are; in which case, I imagine that half a Dollar a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</span>
Quire may be thought a reasonable price, allowing usual
Credit if necessary.</p>

<p>My love to your Family, and Believe me ever,</p>

<p class="r2">Your affectionate Uncle</p>

<p class="r"><span class="smcap">B. Franklin</span>.</p>

<p>The original of this letter is in the collection of
Miss Rosalie V. Halsey.</p>

<p>Competitors and collectors have often complained
that I have frequently purchased at auction rare
books that they especially desired and that I did not
give them a chance. Quite true! But I have often
tasted the same bitter medicine myself. I recall,
very vividly, a certain day in May 1913, when the
Crane sale was being held in New York and there
was a tiny <i>Royal Primer</i> included among the items,
which I felt belonged to my collection of children’s
books. Printed in Philadelphia in 1753 by James
Chattin, this <i>Royal Primer</i> was the only one of its
kind in existence. In the good old days when George
D. Smith was czar of the auction rooms, all other
dealers and collectors were under a terrific strain the
moment he appeared. We knew it was almost hopeless
to bid against him.</p>

<p>At that time Mr. Smith represented Mr. Henry E.
Huntington. He entered the auction room armed
with as many unlimited bids as a porcupine has
quills. Mr. Smith seemed to take a peculiar delight
in running up bids on the little juvenile books I
craved. And I had set my heart on the <i>Royal Primer</i>
from the moment it was shown to the audience—a
beautiful copy in its original sheep cover. I was
prepared to pay as high as $200 for it, but as I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</span>
watched Smith, the very shadow and auction voice
of Mr. Huntington himself, I had serious doubts of
obtaining it. The bidding started at ten dollars.
Imagine my emotion when it rose rapidly to $1000!
I felt a complete bankrupt. It was no small task to
bid against this octopus of the game, and when the
<i>Royal Primer</i> was finally mine at the absurdly high
sum of $1225 I arose quickly and went out for air.</p>

<p>The contents of the primers are generally the
same. They begin with a rhymed alphabet with illustrations,
words, and syllables for spelling lessons.
Many of the earliest ones contain verses which were
supposed to have been written by the English martyr,
John Rogers, just before his execution, for the benefit
of his “nine small children, and one at the breast.”
Mrs. Rogers and the children are depicted calmly
watching the head of the family at the stake as he is
about to go up in flames. Their little faces are like
so many cranberries.</p>

<p>Later primers are equally amusing, sometimes
with frontispieces of George III, and others have
dubious likenesses of Our President. Not even the
mother of George Washington could have recognized
her boy’s features in these crude pictures. But
the primers were very popular, and the Puritans
continued to issue them. The <i>Beauties of the Primer</i>
was followed by the <i>Primer Improved</i> and the <i>Progressive
Primer</i>, a more elaborate departure, which boasts
colored illustrations.</p>

<p>It was during the early part of the eighteenth century
that the Puritan taste began to broaden a bit.
In addition to the early primers and catechisms,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</span>
children were encouraged to read the Holy Bible in
verse and semireligious books which had come into
fashion. A friend—Mr. Thomas E. Streeter, of
New York, a most discriminating collector—found
in a volume of pamphlets, <i>Some Excellent Verses for
the Education of Youth</i>, to which is added <i>Verses for
Little Children, by a Friend</i>, Boston, printed by Bartholomew
Green, 1708. It was the only copy extant,
having miraculously escaped the rough usage of tiny
hands. I despaired of obtaining it, when one day Mr.
Streeter generously sent it to me with his compliments.
Here is a sample of the Biblical verse as it was written
to impress the small reader. Imagine the youth of
New England, born with all the lively desires of a
modern child, spending a Sunday afternoon memorizing
such rhythms as:—</p>


<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Though I am Young, yet I may Die,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And hasten to Eternity.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>


<p>Another melancholy book of poetry for children
was printed in 1740 in New Haven by T. Green. My
copy is the only one known to-day. Its pleasant
beginning must have charmed the small reader; thus:
“Children, you must die in a short time. You will
soon go to a Heaven of Joy or a burning Hell.” There
are seven poems in each. The author cannot resist
depicting a lugubrious future. Imagine your own
child memorizing this sample, called “The Play”:—</p>

<p>Among all the books I have seen that were published
at this period in the Colonies, I have found
but one which might be taken seriously if issued
to-day. It treats upon an international problem,
good behavior, which, alas, is the bugaboo of children
the world over. Personally I have always felt that
it is the most terrible and obnoxious of all the moralities—but
then, I’m only an old bachelor! <i>The
School of Good Manners Composed for the Help of
Parents in teaching their Children how to carry it in
their places during their Minority</i> was brought out in
Boston, reprinted and sold by T. and J. Fleet at the
Heart and Crown, in Cornhill, 1772. It begins with
“Twenty mixt Precepts,” such as “Honour the
Magistrates,” and tells little children plainly what
and what not to do. Under a heading of “Behaviour
at the Table,” it admonishes: “Spit not, cough not,
nor blow thy nose at the table, if it may be avoided.”
“Behaviour When in Company” is a little less stringent,
perhaps, than one might expect. It reads: “Spit
not in the room, but in the corner.” Further: “Let
thy countenance be moderately cheerful, neither
laughing nor frowning.” “For Behaviour at School”
one must “Bawl not aloud in making complaints,”
and “Jog not the table or desk on which another
writes.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</span></p>

<p>It is not probable that these righteously exemplary
books could be all things to all children. What a
welcome change the <i>Prodigal Daughter</i> must have
been! Isaiah Thomas, of Worcester, printed her history
in 1771, in Boston, before he became famous as
the publisher of simpler children’s books such as
<i>Goody Two Shoes</i>. In many of these early books the
title page relates practically the entire story in
scenario form. A case in point is the <i>Prodigal
Daughter, or a strange and wonderful relation, shewing
how a gentleman of vast estates in Bristol, had a proud
and disobedient Daughter, who, because her parents
would not support her in all her extravagance, bargained
with the Devil to poison them. How an Angel informed
her Parents of her design. How she lay in a trance four
days; and when she was put in the grave, she came to
life again.</i> Quite a happy ending for an eighteenth-century
prodigal!</p>

<p>The gradual change which took place in juvenile
literature was brought about partly by the captivating
whimsicalities of Oliver Goldsmith. The finest
collection of Goldsmith’s books is in the beautiful
library of my dear friend, William M. Elkins, but I
have a few of Goldsmith’s juveniles that even he
has been unable to obtain. Goldsmith’s delightful
books for children, which his publisher, John
Newbery, had bound in gilt paper and adorned with
woodcuts, were sent over here from his far-famed
shop at the corner of Saint Paul’s Churchyard in
London. When they were reprinted in staid New
England, they were a startling innovation to the
book trade. Then old ballads began to return to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</span>
market, each with some striking change also. Contrast
the stern outpourings of the learned Cotton
Mather with Doctor Goldsmith’s “Elegy on that
Glory of her Sex, Mrs. Mary Blaize”:—</p>

<p>The <i>Royal Battledoor</i>, the <i>Mother Goose Melodies</i>,

<p>I was spending a week-end last summer with some
friends who have a large library consisting chiefly of
the classical English authors. I had been out one
afternoon, and as I returned to the house, was met
halfway by my hostess. She had a distraught look,
and before I could inquire what had happened, she
said, “I am frightfully upset! What do you think I
found Tommy doing just now in the library? Reading
that nasty old book, Fielding’s <i>Tom Jones</i>!”</p>

<p>Her son Tommy was twelve years old. “What
have you done about it?” I asked, trying to suppress
a smile.</p>

<p>“I took it from him and put it in the stove!”</p>

<p>She refused to believe me when I told her that
<i>Tom Jones</i>, <i>Clarissa Harlowe</i>, and <i>Pamela</i> were read
aloud in the evening to all members of the family in
Puritan New England, and Miss Rosalie V. Halsey relates
that when certain passages became too affecting,
the more sensitive listeners retired to their rooms
to weep! Sometime later I showed her my copy of
<i>Tom Jones</i>, abridged especially for youthful reading,
with its crude little woodcut facing the title page,
and this explanatory verse beneath:—</p>

<p>The moral of <i>Tom Jones</i>, as translated for its
youthful readers, seems to boil down to this: If you
are a good child you will never annoy your neighbors!
Fancy Henry Fielding’s amusement when <i>Tom
Jones</i> appeared abridged for children! What a
marvelous leap this was from the dry-as-dust New
England primers and Protestant Tutors, from austere
catechisms to—<i>Tom Jones</i>!</p>

<p>Printers early discovered that books for children
should be made in proportion to their little clients—small.
Miniature volumes have always held a great
fascination for children of all ages. Their very neatness
and compactness make them seem the more
precious and desirable. Perhaps it was with a view
to making Bible stories valued more highly by their
small readers that they were printed in tiny volumes
called Thumb Bibles. These adorable wee volumes,
illustrated with crude woodcuts, are extremely rare.
Not long ago a lady came to my Philadelphia office
with an old-fashioned hand bag—the silk gathered
sort, roomy if not beautiful. I noticed that it stuck
out in little points, and wondered what on earth she
could have brought in it. My curiosity was more
than gratified when she emptied it upon my desk—some
twenty Thumb Bibles! When I asked her what
she wanted for these little charmers she shook her
head and said that anything I cared to offer would
be acceptable. I suggested $300. She looked at me
aghast.</p>

<p>“Why,” she said, “I would have been willing to
take twenty-five!”</p>

<p>Children began to assert themselves, beginning<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</span>
with the last quarter of the eighteenth century.
They became individuals rather than so much
parental property. Thomas Bradford must have
realized this when, in 1775, he placed such juvenile
delights upon the market as <i>The Scotch Rogue</i>, <i>Moll
Flanders</i>, <i>Lives of Highwaymen</i>, <i>Lives of Pirates</i>, <i>The
Buccaneers of America</i>, and <i>The Lives of the Twelve
Cæsars</i>.</p>

<p>At the beginning of the nineteenth century shockers
began to appear. Lurid tales of dastardly deeds were
read by children who hitherto knew life through
such stories as <i>The Prize for Youthful Obedience</i>, <i>The
Search After Happiness</i>, <i>Little Truths</i>, and other
edifying concoctions. The colorful experiences of
<i>Motherless Mary, A Young and Friendless Orphan who
was eventually Decoyed to London</i>, appearing from the
presses of a New York house in 1828, interpreted life
in a new if less safe way. John Paul Jones’s <i>Life</i> was
issued with a terrifying frontispiece and in a dress to
attract small boys with an admiration and envy for
buccaneers and their fierce and bloody lives. Even
Noah Webster, that staid dictionarist, wrote <i>The
Pirates, A Tale for Youth</i>.</p>

<p>The interest in American history began at the close
of the Revolution. The scenes of all the juvenile
histories were formerly laid in foreign countries.
The American Colonies now had their own history,
and some of the rarest, and perhaps the most attractive
to the student, are those dealing with this
subject. <i>The History of America abridged for the use
of Children of all Denominations, adorned with cuts</i>,
Philadelphia, Wrigley and Berriman, 1795, is engaging<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</span>
and wonderful. The little illustrations are
marvelous examples of the illustrator’s skill. On account
of the expense, the publisher duplicated the
portraits, and one cut served for several worthies.
Thus Christopher Columbus, General Montgomery,
and His Excellency Richard Howel, Governor of New
Jersey, were depicted exactly alike, the American
eighteenth-century military costume looking picturesque
and fearful on Columbus.</p>

<p>The <i>New York Cries</i>, printed and sold by Mahlon
Day in 1826, is particularly entertaining. According
to the introduction of this little book: “New York
island is 15 miles long, and from one to two miles
broad. It is laid out in spacious streets and avenues,
with large squares and market places. The circuit
of the city is about eight miles, and the number of
buildings which it contains is estimated at 30,000,
and the inhabitants at about 172,000.”</p>

<p>I cannot resist quoting the cry of Sand, as it is a
reflection of the time when New Yorkers used sand
on their floors, instead of costly Oriental rugs:—</p>


<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Sand! Here’s your nice white Sand!</div>

    <div class="verse indent4">When strew’d at your door.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>


<div class="blockquot">

<p>This sand is brought from the seashore in vessels,
principally from Rockaway Beach, Long Island. It is
loaded into carts, and carried about the streets of New
York, and sold for about 12½ cents per bushel. Almost
every little girl or boy knows that it is put on newly
scrubbed floors, to preserve them clean and pleasant.</p>

<p>But since people have become rich, and swayed by the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</span>
vain fashions of the world, by carpeting the floors of their
houses, there does not appear to be so much use for Sand
as in the days of our worthy ancestors.</p>
</div>

<p><i>Peter Piper’s Practical Principles of Plain and Perfect
Pronunciation</i> was published in Philadelphia by
W. Johnson in 1836. Issued nearly a century ago,
it is still enshrined in our hearts. Although there
were many editions issued in America, few have survived
the tooth of time and the voracity of these
youthful readers. The Philadelphia edition had perfect
pictures properly painted, and it is one of the
most charming morsels ever devised “to please the
palates of Pretty, Prattling Playfellows.” Two
quotations are given in order to bring us all back to
the time long ago when Peter Piper meant so much
to us.</p>

<p>The book will always remain attractive to us, but
when we think of the youthful minds it has mixed,
the jaws it has dislocated, the tongues it has tied,
we can only remark that we love it for its faults!</p>

<p>When I look into these old editions, these picturesque
little volumes, which reveal so charmingly
the quickening change from the days of the Pilgrim
Fathers, I am surprised that some enterprising publisher
does not reissue them to-day. Such stories as
<i>Pug’s Visit to Mr. Punch</i>, <i>Who Killed Cock Robin</i>,
<i>The History of Little Fannie</i>, <i>Little Eliza and Little
Henry</i>, as well as the droll <i>Old Dame Trudge and Her
Parrot</i>, would go as well now as one hundred years
ago. I think they would make a fortune for someone—although
I do not guarantee it!</p>

<p>Two specially made miniature bookcases house
my whole collection of children’s books. On either
side of a large sixteenth-century Spanish bookcase
they hang against the wall, and visitors to my Philadelphia
home take delight in looking at their quaint
illustrations and the still quainter text. But alas,
my library is now like a nursery without children.
The whole family—eight hundred—have traveled
to New York and are on exhibition in the New York
Public Library, where they may be seen by all who
are interested.</p>

<p class="c large sp">OLD BIBLES</p>


<p><span class="smcap large">What</span> is the greatest discovery in the history of
books? This is the question with which I am constantly
bombarded. In letters from all parts of the
world the embryonic bookman, the novice collector,
the casual lover of books, the intelligent, the stupid—they
make this their leading question. And although
I have never been accused of unseemly virtue, I rejoice
that the answer is exactly as it should be:
the first printed Bible.</p>

<p>The momentous recognition of the now famed
Gutenberg Bible occurred in the middle of the eighteenth
century. Book collecting was already beginning
to discard its sombre, conservative guise as an occupation
of the religious in monasteries, or as a pastime
of the old and very rich. Now this discovery came
like a flaming meteor against the literary sky.</p>

<p>So many astounding finds have been made in
out-of-the-way places, it is somewhat surprising
that this first and greatest printed work should have
been identified in the very heart of Paris. In a
preceding article I have related the remarkable manner
in which several other rare books turned up.
There was the copy of <i>Pilgrim’s Progress</i> which made
its way from obscurity in the barber shop of a small
English town to international fame in a London auction
room. And another valuable book, Shakespeare’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</span>
<i>Venus and Adonis</i>, hid unsuspected for years
in the lumber room of an English estate before it was
brought to light; and a similar copy, equally rare,
was used as an archer’s target at Shrewsbury before
its value was accidentally recognized. What irony,
then, that this, the greatest book of all time, the
Gutenberg Bible, should have rested in the very
centre of a literary stronghold perhaps centuries
before its unique preëminence was detected!</p>

<p>Thousands of eyes during that time had gazed
uncomprehendingly upon this marvel of the printer’s
art in the celebrated library of Cardinal Mazarin in
Paris. How often it was read by strangely undiscerning
eyes, eyes of students, eyes of connoisseurs,
looked upon by true lovers of the antique! They saw
nothing in it but a Bible—one more early Bible.
Such men as Descartes, Voiture, and Corneille doubtless
turned its pages many times. Certainly it must
have been something of a curiosity, even in those
days. But what scant imaginations they had! The
very idea chills me!</p>

<p>It will forever remain a mystery, that Gutenberg
Bible in Paris. How did it get there from Germany?
Who brought it? How did it happen to be in the
Mazarin Library? Did some serious-minded book
agent of old France, if there were any then,
bargain quietly with the scarlet-robed Cardinal, or
was the road to its destination one of intrigue, of
dishonor, and finally violence? Alas, that we book
lovers will never know! A little pilfering here and
there was never known to upset Mazarin, if the book
he coveted was worthy of it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</span></p>

<p>Often I have wondered, when visiting his musty
library, what the ancient walls behind the shelves
could tell were they suddenly given the power of
speech. As the old proverb runs, “Walls have ears.”
Nor is it difficult in that majestic palace to watch
through half-closed eyes, veiled, of course, by your
imagination, the proud old churchman as he pridefully
surveys his magnificent books. Perhaps you
can see him lingering before the provocative loveliness
of gleaming parchment and morocco covers; observe
him as he tenderly removes from its resting place
some diabolical work of Machiavelli; or he may pace
elegantly between the ancient lecterns and reading
posts to bend in silent tribute before the disquieting
beauty of some massive old missal. I have easily
pictured not only His Eminence but many assistants
as well, searching among the ancient tomes; sandaled
monks, learned scholars and librarians, poets and
courtiers, they have all passed me in that renowned
library, unconscious of my presence. And how the
chains still jangle which for centuries have held captive
certain small and attractive volumes on shelf and
table. Some sophisticated doubters may sigh as they
read these lines, thinking: “Poor Rosenbach, what
the vineyards of France must have done to him!”</p>

<p>After I purchased the Melk copy of the Gutenberg
Bible last year, I learned, from the hordes of visitors
who came to see it and through the letters of congratulation
and inquiry with which I was flooded,
that most people thought this the only copy in
existence. As a matter of fact, about forty-three copies
have been discovered thus far, ten of which are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</span>
now in public and private libraries in this country.
Perhaps there are others in hiding; there is always
that glorious chance. But the very fact that there
were these other copies, scattered in various libraries
in the old centres of Europe, copies which were there,
doubtless, from the time Gutenberg accomplished his
stupendous work, makes the more remarkable the
first disclosure of this Bible, nearly three centuries
after its publication.</p>

<p>Think of the many wise graybeards who spent
their lives searching for knowledge in the vast libraries
of Vienna, of Berlin, of Göttingen, of Prague,
and at Oxford and Cambridge, those centuries ago;
men who saw and read these volumes and yet did
not question their strange peculiarity. For although
the Gutenberg Bible gives the effect of a fastidiously
written manuscript, it is not only the earliest but
actually the most beautiful work of printing the
world has ever known. It was the first work to
come from any press using movable types. Whether
these were cut from wood or moulded in lead can
never be conclusively proved. This is immaterial,
however, except to the student of typography. The
type itself is a large Gothic one, and the ink, now
nearly five centuries old, is to-day as black and glossy
as the hair of a Japanese beauty. The majestic
Gothic lettering was the prevailing one used in Germany
for ecclesiastical works at that time, and therefore
it was but natural to use it as a model. The
pages of the Gutenberg Bible are perfectly spaced
in double columns.</p>

<p>The great work was published in two states; some<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</span>
copies were printed on paper, others on vellum.
The feel of the paper always fascinates me, so firm
it is, so beautiful in appearance. It seems alive, yet
there is something definitely final about it. It is as
though the paper of the Gutenberg Bible had proudly
indicated from its inception that nothing finer, nothing
more perfect ever could be made. Nor is the
vellum of any other old book of finer texture than
that which Gutenberg, the master printer, used.
The rarest vellum is from the thinnest, the most
velvety part of the inner skin of the sheep. This
Gutenberg was careful to select, and his Bibles
printed on vellum are much more valuable to-day
than those printed on paper.</p>

<p>It thrills the lover of books when he observes the
superb taste Johann Gutenberg showed in the year
1455. A decade later, printers, his pupils, began to
be patronized by princes of Church and State. It
was they who ordered the most beautiful books,
made especially for their private gratification. But
there is no record of Gutenberg having any such
incentive as wealth or approbation. He must have
followed some compelling desire of his own which
led to the creation of the perfect book.</p>

<p>It was about 1750 that Guillaume-François de
Bure, a young Frenchman, proved himself a veritable
prodigy among discoverers. At that time he employed
every moment he could spare, working in the
Mazarin Library, which, since the death of its
founder, had fortunately been in the hands of intelligent
and appreciative men. It happened that
De Bure one day stumbled upon two old volumes he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</span>
could not recall having seen before. He glanced at
them as he passed, and was so taken by their unusual
beauty that he resolved to return to study
them as soon as possible. Almost the first thing De
Bure observed was that there were forty-two lines
on the page. He had seen, in those magnificent
ecclesiastical surroundings, many wonderful Bibles.
In a state of hopeful excitement he looked for and
finally located another copy of the glorious book
similar to the one in the Mazarin Library, in the
Electoral Library in Mainz. This is the copy which
is now in the French National Library. De Bure
read the inscription in an ancient hand at the end
of each volume, several lines stating that the books
had been rubricated and bound in the year of our
Lord 1456. With these slender facts as a basis, he
set about further to establish the authenticity of the
greatest bibliographical discovery of all time.</p>

<p>There were two issues of the Gutenberg (or, as it
was originally called, the Mazarin,) Bible. The first
contains forty, forty-one, and forty-two lines to the
column. But this, as a rule, is at the beginning of
the book, where it is apparent that Gutenberg was
experimenting; he was trying to evolve to his own
satisfaction the form of what has since been acclaimed
the greatest monument of the printer’s art. To obtain
the very first issue of the Gutenberg Bible—that
is an achievement! Of all books in the world it
is the most important to possess in its elemental
state, for it was in this condition that it first saw the
light of day. It is true that there is nothing nobler,
nothing finer, nothing more beautiful than the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</span>
Gutenberg Bible in its last completed phase, but to
me the embryonic stage of the first printed book is
the most important. Only the first “gathering,” as
we say technically, comprises the first printed book.</p>

<p>I believe Gutenberg began printing his Bible a
little before 1450, and devoted the first three or four
years to perfecting the movable types. But I doubt
if it could have been much earlier than 1455 when he
finally completed the first copy. In all probability
he was assisted by his friend, Johann Fust, who
supplied the money with which Gutenberg bought
materials for a press and types. Aided, too, by
Fust’s son-in-law, Peter Schöffer, they brought
eternal fame to the name of their already famous
city, Mainz. Later many apprentices from Gutenberg’s
and Fust’s atelier went southward to France,
Italy, and Spain, where they established the first
presses in the great cities of Paris, Rome, Florence,
and Seville. These specimens of early printing are
known to the specialists as incunabula, or books
representing the cradle of printing. The term has
been extended so as to include all works printed
before 1500.</p>

</div>

<p>Some authorities have questioned the claim of
Gutenberg as the inventor of printing. Coster of
Haarlem has been put forth as the real discoverer.
There are fragments of early printing with Gothic
types that students of typography have dubbed
Costeriana. I cannot enter here into a discussion of
this controversy. Perhaps both sides are right. At
any rate, I have read reams and reams on the subject
and have become sadder if not wiser at each
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</span>perusal. Mademoiselle Pellechet, a celebrated bibliophile
of the nineteenth century, studied the question
deeply. In the end, as bibliography is a science in
which women have distinguished themselves, a
woman will probably say the last word! Perhaps
the best person to give an opinion on the subject
to-day is Miss Belle da Costa Greene, the learned
director of the Pierpont Morgan Library.</p>

<p>When I visited England two or three years ago I
was invited to Windsor Castle to see the beautiful
library belonging to King George. The librarian,
the Honorable John Fortescue, the authority on the
history of the English Army, showed me many
magnificent volumes and manuscripts. Among them
was that glorious rarity known to the initiated as
the 1457 Psalter, printed on vellum by Fust and
Schöffer. There are in the royal library many works
of great historical importance, and I listened with
delight to his fascinating stories relating to them.</p>

<p>Often during the afternoon I stood before the windows
of the library to look out upon the vista of
green lawns, the winding Thames, and Eton College
a few miles in the distance. I thought of Thomas
Gray and others who had known so intimately the
country about me, of famous men whose names
were connected with famous books, and a sudden
desire came over me—a desire to see and pay homage
to the most beautiful book in the world. By the
time I was ready to leave the Castle I had decided
to motor over to Eton.</p>

<p>When I arrived I immediately went to the library
attendant and asked him to let me see the Gutenberg<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</span>
Bible. This copy in the library of Eton College
is to my mind the most noble specimen of all. It is
in its contemporary binding of old leather decorated
with the original metal clasps and bosses, and it
bears the name of the binder, Johann Fogel, who
goes down in history as the binder of the first printed
book.</p>

<p>At the very time of my visit to Eton the newspapers
in England were running editorial comment about
several purchases I had just made privately and at
auction sales. They complained I was taking away
the greatest monuments of literature from their
shores. The old attendant at Eton, noting my enthusiasm
as I turned the pages of this beautiful
Bible, said to me, in a tone tickled with pride,
“Wouldn’t that Doctor Rosenbach like to carry off
this Gutenberg Bible too?”</p>

<p>Gutenberg’s Bible was set up from the Latin
manuscript version designated by scholars as the
Vulgate. Previous to its issue most manuscript
Bibles were written either in Greek or Hebrew. Now,
for the first time, it appeared available to all who
could read, translated into Latin, the “vulgar” or
common language of the Church.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="f65">
<img src="images/fig65.jpg" alt="belle da costa greene">
<p class="caption">BELLE DA COSTA GREENE</p>
</div>

<p>During the past few years I have purchased four
copies of the Gutenberg Bible. The first, at the Hoe
sale in 1912, was an edition printed on paper, and
with Alfred Quaritch I later sold it to the late P. A. B.
Widener, of Philadelphia. It is now in the collection
of his son, Mr. Joseph Widener. The second copy,
in a superb binding by Fogel, and now in the greatest
private collection of Bibles in this country, came
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</span>from the library of the late James W. Ellsworth, of
Chicago. It was in a strange manner that I bought
this copy. I was halfway across the Atlantic. Before
sailing I had been treating for its purchase, along
with the rest of his splendid library. I completed the
transaction by wireless. It was thus that the fifteenth
century and the twentieth met in mid-ocean! To
buy a Gutenberg Bible by radio—it seemed almost
sacrilegious.</p>

<p>And this recalls another story. I met for the first
time aboard one of the great liners a distinguished
collector, a man of great taste and judgment. He
said to me in the smoking room, fifteen hundred
miles out of New York, “Have you a set of the four
folios of Shakespeare?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” I replied, “a fine one, the Trowbridge
set; at least, I have if it has not been sold.”</p>

<p>He asked me to verify it by wireless, which I did,
and on receipt of the message he purchased it in
mid-Atlantic. No man that ever lived had the prophetic
foresight of Shakespeare; yet even he could
not have pictured such a thing. And the price?
That is still another story.</p>

<p>I purchased another Gutenberg Bible, printed on
paper, at the Carysfort sale in London, four years
ago, and paid £9500—a little less than $50,000—for
it. To-day it rests, with other great examples of
printing and literature, in the library of Mr. Carl H.
Pforzheimer, in New York City.</p>

<p>The Melk copy, which I bought at the Anderson
Galleries last year, was as exciting an acquisition
as I have ever made. Of course there were many<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</span>
collectors and dealers besides myself who yearned to
own it. The price I paid for it—$106,000—was
like the first shot of the Revolution, heard around
the world. Mrs. E. S. Harkness bought this copy
from me and most graciously bestowed it upon the
Library of Yale University, in memory of Mrs.
Stephen V. Harkness. It is certainly one of the
greatest gifts ever made to a university in this country.
So many copies have passed into public institutions
during the past few years, it is unlikely that
many more perfect ones can come into the market.
What will its price be in the future? One could as
well stem the tides as to block its steady and irresistible
march. It is only a matter of time. To-day
it sells for more than $100,000; more than $1,000,000
will some day be a reasonable price for it.</p>

<p>Although much stress has been laid upon the
value and rarity of the Gutenberg forty-two-line
Bible, and it is generally thought to be the most
valuable in the world, I believe the thirty-six-line
Bible (known as the Pfister, or Bamberg, Bible) is
infinitely rarer. It also was the work of a Mainz
printing press, and was probably made under Gutenberg’s
supervision, after he had finished the one
which now bears his name. In the old days it was
thought to have been printed before the Gutenberg
Bible, but scholars have proved by long study that
mistakes are made which could only have been the
result of using Gutenberg’s for copy, instead of one
of the written texts. There are only fourteen copies of
this thirty-six-line Bible known; four are in England,
seven in Germany, one is in Belgium, one in France,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</span>
and another in Austria. Yet in all this broad land
there is not one copy. But I rejoice in having a single
leaf of it, which, I assure you, I prize greatly.</p>

<p>Probably the most beautiful Bible after the
Gutenberg is in two volumes, forming what is
known as the 1462 Bible. It is the first one that is
dated, and was issued at Mainz, printed by Fust
and Schöffer, August 14, 1462. The copies on vellum
seem to be more numerous than those on paper. I
bought the last copy, belonging to the Earl of Carysfort,
for £4800. It is not only the first dated Bible
but the earliest example of a book formally divided
into two volumes. But it is not considered a rare
edition of the Bible in any sense of the word, as
more than sixty copies are known. In fact, we had
two copies of it at one time in our New York vault,
both of which were illuminated with grotesque birds
and beasts, probably by the same artist. It is odd
that, although there are few collections of incunabula
in South America, there are two copies of this
Bible in the National Library at Rio de Janeiro.</p>

<p>Probably the greatest sport of all is the collecting
of Bibles in manuscript. It takes a king’s ransom
to-day to secure a really fine one. I do not mean
the ordinary late-fifteenth-century ones, which are
quite common, but those executed from the ninth
to the twelfth century, especially when they are
illustrated. Of course, the earliest codices, the very
foundation stones of the history of the Bible, such
as the Codex Vaticanus in Rome, the Alexandrinus
in the British Museum, and the Sinaiticus at Leningrad,
are safely beyond the purse of the richest<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</span>
collector. The Pierpont Morgan Library contains
the finest collection of illuminated Bibles in America.
The vault at 33 East Thirty-sixth Street, New York,
is an achievement almost unequaled in the history of
collecting. It is like a view of Paradise. The latest
acquisition by Mr. J. P. Morgan of some of the
Holkham manuscripts from the library of the Earl
of Leicester is a notable triumph in the history of
great libraries.</p>

<p>Some years ago I was talking with Mr. Henry E.
Huntington in his old library at 2 East Fifty-seventh
Street, New York. I said most humbly, although
with proper pride, “How would you like to own the
original Conqueror Bible of the architect of the Tower
of London?”</p>

<p>“There ain’t no sich animile,” quoted Mr. Huntington.</p>

<p>I thereupon produced from a cavernous Gladstone
bag two large folio volumes, elegantly bound in blue
morocco. “This is it,” I said. The Bible was written
in the eleventh century for Gundulph, 1024-1108,
Bishop of Rochester, who came over with William
the Conqueror and later became the designer of the
Tower of London. On the first leaf of each volume
the bishop had written an elaborate curse, excommunicating
anyone who should destroy, mutilate, or
carry it off. When I showed Mr. Huntington these
fatal words, he said to me, with a twinkle in his eye,
“You old rogue, this applies to you, too, you know.
I will take the Bible, but without the curse!”</p>

<p>I recall one day several years ago when I visited
the library of the late Sir Thomas Phillipps, at
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</span>Thirlestaine House, Cheltenham. His grandson, Mr.
T. FitzRoy Fenwick, and I were looking over the
precious volumes, and we talked of Sir Thomas’s
ardent love of manuscripts. For more than fifty
years he had been the world’s greatest gatherer of
everything written by the hand of man. His knowledge
was equal to his love, and he succeeded in
forming an unrivaled library of manuscripts, which
included some of the greatest specimens in existence.
He did not confine himself to Continental examples
alone, but was the first great collector of manuscripts
relating to America. Sir Thomas Phillipps was
the patron not only of Lord Kingsborough, whose researches
on Mexico are well known, but of George
Catlin, who depicted so graphically the life of the
American Indian. Mr. Fenwick, who inherited from
his grandfather his appreciation and love of fine
things, and who possesses an almost unequaled
knowledge of old manuscripts, asked me if I had ever
seen a manuscript containing Anglo-Saxon writing.
I said that I had not, and he thereupon produced
the Four Gospels, an English manuscript written in
West Anglia in the time of King Alfred, <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 850-900,
which contained splendid full-page illustrations of
an unusual type. There upon the margins were
characters in Anglo-Saxon, written long before the
Conqueror came to the shores of Britain.</p>

<p>Nothing, however, surprises me at Thirlestaine
House. One day Mr. Fenwick showed me the Liesborn
Gospels, a superb manuscript made in the ninth
century for King Widekind, the only successful opponent
of Charlemagne. It was in its old binding of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</span>
carved wood, and is one of the few very early manuscripts
in existence giving the name of the scribe
who wrote it.</p>

<p>He also showed to me the famous French Historiated
Bible of the fourteenth century, in two
magnificent volumes, which contained almost a hundred
illustrations, quite in the modern manner, more
like William Blake than an artist of old Touraine. I
now have these three precious Biblical manuscripts,
and I doubt whether there is a nobler assemblage in
existence.</p>

<p>To my mind the most inspiringly beautiful and
important early Hebrew manuscript of the Bible is
that in the remarkable collection of Mr. David
Sassoon, of London. It should be reproduced in
facsimile so that all students here and abroad might
study not only its unique text but its glorious illustrations
as well.</p>

<p>One of the great discoveries in the history of these
early Bibles occurred right here at our place in New
York, seven years ago. Mr. Sydney C. Cockerell,
the great student of manuscripts, called upon me,
and I showed him six pictures from the Bible and
said that they were by a Spanish artist of the thirteenth
century.</p>

<p>He looked at them for a moment and said, “No,
they’re English!” I could scarcely believe him,
although no one knows more about manuscripts
than he. “Let me take them to my hotel and study
them. I think they are the work of the earliest
known English illuminator, W. de Brailes.”</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="f67">

<p class="caption">CARVED AND POLYCHROMED WOODEN BINDING OF THE<br>

</div>

<p>He took them with him. If they were English
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</span>they would be immensely valuable—worth far more
than I, old Captain Kidd, asked for them. You bet I
awaited anxiously his return.</p>

<p>Finally he showed up one day, and said, “The
only trouble with you, Doctor Rosenbach, is that
you do not use the eyes God gave you.” Lo and
behold, he pointed to the halo on one of the saints,
and there in neat characters were the magic words:
“W. de Brail(es) me f(e)cit.” It was one of the
greatest attributions ever made by a scholar, and
they were, now beyond even the shadow of a doubt,
the work of the very artist he had named. According
to Mr. Eric G. Millar: “There has never been
a more triumphant vindication of connoisseurship.”
These six drawings are now in England in the collection
of Mr. A. Chester Beatty, who has one of the
choicest libraries of Oriental and European manuscripts.
Every year when I go to England I renew,
through the kind offices of Mr. Beatty, my acquaintance
with the spirit of that doughty old illuminator,
W. de Brailes.</p>

<p>Very few forgers have had the courage to try
their hands at duplicating Biblical manuscripts. I
have always been amazed at the enormous amount of
self-confidence a man by the name of Shapira must
have had when he offered the British Museum several
important-looking manuscript scrolls. They contained
the text of the Pentateuch, and were, he
claimed, from the very hands of Moses! Of course,
every expert and noted scholar who happened to be
in London at the time went to see these scrolls, which
were placed on exhibition at the Museum. They<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</span>
were scrutinized carefully, admired as works of
curiosity, but no one believed for a moment that
they were genuine. Any Semitic scholar knows perfectly
well that writing for literary purposes was unknown
at the time of Moses. Yet even though
Shapira had used an alphabet belonging to a much
later period in history, his handiwork was decidedly
interesting. Finally he was informed that his offerings
were considered a fraud. He left England
bitterly disappointed and went to Belgium. Not
long after he arrived there the continental newspapers
announced that Shapira had committed
suicide. Even then, when certain of his victims read
the lines, they wrote to the papers protesting that
the man could not be dead, and openly accused him
of fabrication even in connection with his own
demise. Such is fame!</p>

<p>The most interesting experiments in the history
of pictorial art were the attempts to produce picture
books for the use of the middle and lower classes
of Europe in the fifteenth century, most of whom
could not read. The few specimens of the Block
Books, as they are called, extant to-day, indicate
they were made up of single leaves printed on one
side of the paper only. These blocks were all cut
by hand from a slab of hardwood, such as that of
the pear or apple tree. When the impressions were
finally made, the pages were pasted back to back
and bound in rough parchment. It is believed by
some authorities that the earliest Block Books date
from 1440, although others were undoubtedly printed
fifteen to thirty years later.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="f68">

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</span></p>

<p>The <i>Biblia Pauperum</i>, or the Bible for the Poor,
is one of the most interesting examples among the
block books. It is composed almost entirely of crude
illustrations with doses of text or short explanations
and sayings of the Prophets above and below the
pictures, much in the manner of the tabloids of our
own time. No attempt was made to reproduce the
whole Bible or even a complete chapter. It was the
portions familiarly known to the people which were
set down. Thus the story of St. John—“Apocalypsis
S. Joannis”—was one of the favorite subjects,
as was Solomon’s “Song of Songs.”</p>

<p>Block books are, of course, among the most desirable
and the most difficult to obtain of all the
treasures of the bibliophile. Even a single sheet
torn from a block book is valuable. I recall vividly,
when in England many years ago, my first visit to
an old library which contained four perfect block
books, all in magnificent condition. The margins
were uncut and, in fact, they appeared to be exactly
the same as when they left the hands of the unknown
printer in the fifteenth century. Year after year I
returned to this library especially to see them.
Imagine my satisfaction and joy when I was finally
rewarded by the owner, who had decided to part
with them.</p>

<p>There are only three great collections of block
books in this country. One may be seen at the New
York Public Library; another, also in New York,
in the library founded by the late J. Pierpont Morgan;
and the third in the Huntington Library in California.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</span></p>

<p>The very first type-printed book with illustrations
was a Latin edition of the <i>Biblia Pauperum</i>, printed
by Albrecht Pfister, of Bamberg, in 1461. There
are only two copies known: one in the John Rylands
Memorial Library at Manchester, England; the
other in the French National Library at Paris.</p>

<p>Savonarola, the Billy Sunday of his day, was
quick to see the appeal of block books. He had his
own sermons printed and illustrated with woodblock-printed
pictures, which he distributed among
his followers. It was he who drew the masses to religion
at the time when Florentine art was almost at
its peak. He converted Botticelli, caused him to
destroy all the sensuous secular pictures he painted
previous to his conversion, but happily made up for
his loss by inspiring him to paint religious subjects.
What would I not give to possess the charred remains
of the Bible to which Savonarola clung when
he died!</p>

<p>There is perhaps a greater lack of knowledge concerning
old Bibles than of any other subject pertaining
to books. To make matters worse, most
people believe they have accumulated many worthwhile
facts when all they pick up is some chance
misinformation. At least thirty per cent of the
30,000 letters I receive annually are about Bibles or
other religious works, which, according to my correspondents,
“have always been in the family.”
The largest number of letters come from Germany.
But among people of all nationalities the hoary idea
still prevails that age adds value to a Bible. Some
people who are not interested in any book, old or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</span>
otherwise, become excited the moment they find a
Bible more than fifty years old. Clasping it to the
family bosom, they often rush to my library, either
in New York or Philadelphia, buoyed up by an inflated
notion of their treasure’s value, believing they
have sighted a rainbow with a pot of real gold at
the end.</p>

<p>Almost everyone in the world owns or has owned
a Bible. It is the one work which has been translated
into every language; it is the world’s best
seller, and because of this, edition after edition has
appeared in every country. No one knows how
many millions of pounds the Universities of Oxford
and Cambridge have received to date in the revenue
which has always flowed into their coffers as a perquisite
on printed Bibles. The Bible rests beside
one’s bed to-day in hotel rooms throughout the
country. The Gideons’ Bible is the only volume the
stealing of which is considered a virtue instead of a
crime! The Bible is a book which has touched the
hearts of us all at one time or another. When it does
not appeal as a religious work its fascination is felt
in the inexhaustible fund of stories and anecdotes
which have never been matched by the contents of
any secular book ever written. Such tales as those
of Joseph and his brethren, David and Goliath,
Solomon and the two mothers, will never be excelled.</p>

<p>A very old Bible is valuable because of its age
only if it was printed between the time of the Gutenberg
edition, 1455, and the year 1476. Although
there were hundreds of editions of the Bible issued
in Europe before 1500, only a small portion of them<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</span>
may be considered very valuable to-day. After 1476
Bibles must show certain characteristics to make
them sufficiently desirable to the collector’s roving
eye. It goes almost without saying that all first
editions are worth something.</p>

<p>The first Bible printed in Italy, in France, or in
Spain—these are all of great value and rarity as
well. The first Bible printed in one of the secular
languages, in the old days known as the vulgar
tongues, for instance, French, German, Italian, Spanish,
Icelandic, Swedish, Slavonic, Bohemian, or
Basque, these, too, are valuable. Others are the
first printed Bible of Strasburg, issued by Mentelin
before 1460; another printed by Eggestyn in 1466;
the celebrated R Bible, probably published by
Adolf Rusch in 1467 at Strasburg; the Great Bible,
a most beautiful specimen of printing, by Sweynheym
and Pannartz, 1471; and the Great French Bible,
made, oddly enough, in Paris five years later by
three Germans: Gering, Kranz, and Friburger.
Hebrew being the original language of the Old
Testament Scriptures, it is only natural that the
first printed in the Hebrew language—Soncino
1488—should be one of the cornerstones of any
collection of Bibles.</p>

<p>One of the most glorious productions of the Bible
is the Jenson edition, printed in Venice in 1479. I
have a superb copy on vellum, with a special page of
dedication to Pope Sixtus IV. All Bibles with dedications
to or from noted persons immediately become
significant in the estimation of the book lover.</p>

<p>Sometime after the printing of the Vulgate version,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</span>
certain editors, shrewd enough to discern the public
mind, offered a Bible complete with three versions.
In the centre of the page they printed the Vulgate,
while on one side a Hebrew text was printed, and on
the other, a Greek.</p>

<p>But it is to the first English printer, William Caxton,
that the honor should go for the first printed
appearance of any part of the Scriptures in English.
Caxton came from Kent, and in his youth went to
Bruges and Cologne to learn the trade of printer.
He was the first to introduce printing into England
and the first to print any works in English. He was
a scholar of parts, as well as a printer with fine taste,
and himself translated into English many of the
works which he later published. In 1483 he issued
the <i>Golden Legend</i>, which includes lives of Adam,
Abraham, Moses, and other characters of the Old
and New Testaments. Thus it contains nearly all
of the Pentateuch and portions of the Gospels. If
this were generally known and appreciated, I feel
certain the <i>Golden Legend</i> would approach a price
more nearly like that of the Gutenberg Bible. But
as the book game is one of magic and alchemy, this
may happen unexpectedly any time.</p>

<p>Among the fourteen or fifteen Caxtons in my New
York vault, I am happy to say I have a beautiful
copy which contains, unmutilated, the account of
the murder of Thomas A. Becket, as a friend of
mine once wrote it, which has been entirely deleted
from most copies.</p>

<p>Of course almost everyone knows that the first
complete Bible in the English language was the work
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</span>of Miles Coverdale. He finished his translation in
1535, and it was printed that same year at Zurich.
Although as a work of scholarship it may not rank
particularly high,—it is “translated out of Douche
and Latyn,” according to the title,—you will find
many of Coverdale’s memorable and sonorous phrases
preserved in the authorized version in use to-day.</p>

<p>Ten years previous to the appearance of Miles
Coverdale’s work, a contemporary of his, William
Tyndale, had made a valiant effort to translate and
have printed certain portions of the Bible. Perhaps
he was inspired by some spiritual force within himself;
at any rate he believed he could best serve his
fellow countrymen by translating the New Testament
into their language. His ambition grew when one
day in heated dispute with an eminent churchman of
England he was appalled at that worthy’s ignorance
of the Scriptures. His vow, made then and there,
has triumphantly echoed in the ears of all theological
students ever since. “If God spare my life,” said
Tyndale, “ere many years I will cause a boy that
driveth his plough to know more of the Scriptures
than thou dost.”</p>

<p>But Tyndale’s radical project naturally needed
strong financial and political backing. He went to
London, where he believed he had a powerful ally
in his friend, Bishop Cuthbert Tunstall. In this
he soon found he was mistaken; nor could he find
any patron with a sympathetic ear and a sympathetic
purse as well. This circumstance was not strange,
however, because it was just about this time that
the powerful Cardinal Wolsey began to lay plans to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</span>
prevent the “invasion of England by the Word of
God.” Discouraged, Tyndale decided there was little
hope of accomplishing his work in his own land, and
made up his mind to try his luck abroad, even though
it meant exile.</p>

<p>In Hamburg, Tyndale completed his translation
of the New Testament into English from the original
Greek. He went on to Cologne, where he hoped to
find a printer. It is believed that work on the book
was then really started, but that the Senate of
Cologne grew suddenly enraged and shocked at the
thought of so profane a business going on within its
gates. An order was issued to Peter Quentel, the
printer, to prohibit its continuance, but before it
could be carried out Tyndale had fled in panic to
Worms. He took with him his beloved translation,
and perhaps certain pages of the printed work as
well. In Worms, Luther was then at the very height
of his popularity. This must have been a relief to
Tyndale, to find himself in a place where he would
have to undergo no further religious persecution.
And so the New Testament was printed for the first
time in English in a little German city.</p>

<p>Tyndale’s followers doubtless smuggled it into the
home country, because almost immediately this
New Testament began to appear in England. It
filled the clergy with fury, and Bishop Tunstall,
Tyndale’s former friend, even went so far as to have
it burned publicly at St. Paul’s Cross in London.
It was destroyed in other places as well, before gatherings
of ignorant, superstitious, and infuriated people.
Indeed, the public burning by the churchmen<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</span>
of Tyndale’s New Testament became a popular if
serious pastime. And the destruction of Tyndale’s
precious books was a prophetic prelude to his own
martyrdom at the stake a few years later.</p>

<p>All the earliest English Bibles are extraordinarily
rare and worth almost any amount. It is strange to
speak of money in connection with the greatest
spiritual work of all time, but as Bibles are the cornerstones
of any outstanding collection it follows that
they must be bought at a price.</p>

<p>Only a fragment exists of the first edition of Tyndale’s
translation of the New Testament, from the
press of Peter Quentel in Cologne, in 1525. The
second edition, printed also on the Continent, by
Peter Schöffer at Worms, probably late in 1525, is
almost equally rare, as only two imperfect copies
survive. I would cheerfully give more than $50,000
for a copy of the first appearance in print of this
portion of the English Scriptures. Perhaps some
book scout will eventually unearth another. Of the
Tyndale Pentateuch, probably printed at Malborow
by Hans Lufft in 1530, only three perfect copies have
resisted the sharp usages of time. The finest of these
is in the Pierpont Morgan Library.</p>

<p>As to the first complete Bible in the English language,
translated by Coverdale and printed in 1535,
not a single absolutely perfect copy exists. There
are two or three almost perfect examples in England,
none so good in America. There are, however, copies
of this book, more or less defective, in libraries in
this country, such as in the collections of Pierpont
Morgan and Henry E. Huntington, the New York<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</span>
Public Library, the Free Library of Philadelphia, Carl
H. Pforzheimer, and A. Edward Newton. This great
volume is not of excessive rarity, but of excessive
importance. I would risk my chances in this world
and the next to obtain a perfect copy.</p>

<p>Of the so-called Great Bible, seven editions were
issued within two years, 1539-41. They are all
valuable, but not nearly so much so as the earlier
English Bibles. Splendid examples of printing, they
are much in demand by collectors, especially when
perfect.</p>

<p>One of the great monuments of our civilization,
the first edition of the Authorized Version, printed
in London by Robert Barker in 1611, is in every
respect one of the finest things a collector can ever
hope to acquire. The influence of this Book upon
the world has been simply enormous. There were
two editions in 1611, known as the He and She
Bible, the He (quite naturally!) being the earlier and
more in demand. No stones, fair ladies! The distinction
comes from a variant reading in the Book of
Ruth, iii, 15. In the first version it reads “He went
into the citie,” in the second, the later printing, “She
went into the citie.” This change of a single letter
makes all the difference in the world to the collector,
and he has to pay for it. The first issue is worth
several thousands more than the second. This is a
rare and momentous thing, a perfect He bringing
more than a perfect She! It can only occur in the
case of the Bible. I am quite sure that in this even
clergymen will agree with me.</p>

<p>The price of the first edition of the Authorized, or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</span>
King James, Bible, has not been large in the past.
The Huth copy sold at auction in 1911 for only
£164, or about $820, but the future, I feel sure, will
tell another story. Indeed, I think the time when the
collector will give $8000 or $10,000 for a really fine
copy is hovering dangerously near. It is truly a
volume so dear and precious to everyone that it
must soon take its place among the stars.</p>

<p>I remember one day when I was visiting the late
J. P. Morgan many years ago. We sat and talked
in his office in the old building at the corner of Wall
and Broad streets, which in those ancient days bore
the sign, Drexel, Morgan, and Company. Of course,
we vied with each other in a genial way, relating
stories of our quests in discovering rare books, of purchases
we had made at what we considered the proper
prices then, and in general confiding to each other
those tales of adventure so dear to the heart of the
bookman. We talked about old Bibles, especially
those which had belonged to celebrated people. Of
these Mr. Morgan already had a remarkable collection.
His nephew, Mr. Junius Spencer Morgan, had
from the first been a great help to his uncle, with his
genuine flair for really fine books and works of art
generally, and his uncle often took his advice. The
elder Mr. Morgan was a man of great imagination,
who enjoyed book collecting as much as anyone I
have ever known. Suddenly, during our conversation,
his face clouded, and he turned to me and said
in a regretful tone, “Doctor, there is one Bible I
have missed. The last time I was in London, Quaritch
told me about it. He sold it, he said, on his first trip<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</span>
to this country in 1890. It is the great He issue of
1611, and is enriched with the annotations of the
translators of the King James version. The explanations
of the Holy Text were probably made for the
use of Prince Henry. What would I give to have it!”</p>

<p>Now I knew of this Bible, but hadn’t the faintest
idea at the moment where it was or who owned it.
It had been extended to five volumes and bore on
the binding the feathers of the young Prince of
Wales. But when I secured the library of Clarence
S. Bement, one year later, there it was. What luck!
Mr. Morgan, it is unnecessary to state, bought it
immediately.</p>

<p>Among the hundreds of Bibles offered to me each
year there is one type which blooms eternal. It is
the bullet-hole Bible: the Bible which saved grandpa’s
life in the Civil War, or the Revolution—as you
will. For a time I was shown such a succession of
these that my very dreams were haunted by them.
Many a night my rest would be broken when whole
armies charged me, each soldier wearing a protecting
copy of the Holy Scriptures over his heart.</p>

<p>Some people have fondly believed that a tale of
sentiment, plus a dash of bravery, mixed with their
own simulated reverence, would bring value to the
family Bible. The bullet-hole Bible has become such
an old story that every time I hear a shot I think it
is someone aiming at the old family Scriptures in the
back yard.</p>

<p>But this is nothing to the Genevan, or Breeches,
Bible, the commonest of all. It is so named because
of the seventh verse in the third chapter of Genesis:—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Then the eyes of them bothe were opened &amp; they
knewe that they were naked; and they sewed figtre leaves
together, and made themselves breeches.</p>
</div>

<p>The first edition was printed at Geneva in 1560
and copies in good condition are scarce and valuable.
In fact, they are really worth more than the price
they sell for to-day. It was for years the household
Bible of the English race. Although translated by the
English exiles at Geneva during Queen Mary’s reign,
it was dedicated “To the Moste Vertuous and Noble
Quene Elisabet, Quene of England, France, and
Ireland.”</p>

<p>At least two hundred editions of the Bible and
New Testament were issued before 1630, consequently
for centuries it was in almost every home.
The later editions of this Bible have therefore become
the <i>bête noir</i> of every bookseller. They turn
up everywhere, their proud possessors asking fortunes
for copies hardly worth the value of old paper.
The copies published after 1600 are the worst
offenders. It is a pity, for the peace of mind of the
booksellers, that they were not all destroyed in the
Great Fire of London. They still exist to torment
the souls of bookmen, and although the language of
the Genevan Bible has always been considered good,
homely English, the language of the biblio-fiend,
when he receives one on approval, with charges collect,
is certainly more vigorous and expressive.</p>

<p>Not long ago a woman came to my Philadelphia
library with a Breeches Bible. True, it was rather ancient,
authentically dated 1629. From the moment
I met her I realized she suffered from suppressed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</span>
emotions of some sort. Although I am accustomed
to prospective sellers with queer symptoms, I
was rather alarmed. Her hands shook violently,
she was deadly white one moment and a flaming pink
the next. When I inquired what she wanted for her
Bible she replied in quick, nervous tones, “Fifty
thousand dollars!” Now I am always amazed at
these grand ideas of value evinced by the layman.
I hope I do not always show my surprise. Indeed,
some people accuse me of having a poker face. This
Bible was certainly worth no more than twenty
dollars. But before I apprised her of the distressing
news, which I always hate to impart, I was cautious
enough to call in one of my assistants to aid me should
she collapse on my hands.</p>

<p>It is to the eternal credit of bookmen that the
sense of humor has been the ruling passion with
them all. They all see the joyous, the fantastic, the
capricious side. They are never <i>sérieux</i>, never unduly
bowed down with the gravity of their calling.
Although they are ardent, nay, passionate lovers,
they always remain gay and debonair. The history
of old Bibles bears eloquent witness on this point.
Why do Bug Bibles, Vinegar Bibles, Wicked Bibles,
tickle the fantasy of collectors? For instance,
Matthew’s Bible of 1551 contains the reading in
Psalm xci, 5: “So that thou shalt not nede to be
afraid for any bugges by nighte, nor for the arrow
that flyeth by day.” Or think how the Christian
world would have been disrupted if it had followed
the Commandments of the 1631 Bible, which leaves
out entirely the “not” in the Seventh. This terrible,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</span>
wicked book reads: “Thou shalt commit adultery.”
Only four copies escaped the public executioner, and
the poor printer was fined £300 by Archbishop Laud.</p>

<p>Baskett’s Oxford Bible of 1717 is a mine of magnificent
errors, the most amusing being that of “the
parable of the vinegar,” instead of “vineyard.”</p>

<p>There are three tremendously important American
Bibles: the Eliot Indian Bible, the Saur, and the
Aitken Bible. John Eliot, Apostle to the Indians,
translated the Bible into their language and had it
printed in Cambridge, Massachusetts, in 1661-63.
Thus the first Bible issued on this continent was,
appropriately, in the tongue of its natives. And the
second was in German, the first in a European
language printed in America, from the press of
Christopher Saur, at Germantown, Pennsylvania, in
1743. The third, at last in English, was printed in
1782 by R. Aitken “at Pope’s Head, three doors
above the Coffee House, in Market Street,” Philadelphia.
The great demand for early Americana will
surely raise these three treasures to heights at present
undreamed of in the bookman’s philosophy.</p>

<p class="c large sp">WHY AMERICA BUYS ENGLAND’S BOOKS</p>


<p><span class="smcap large">During</span> my frequent visits to England I have often
been asked why Americans are so persistent, even
voracious, in acquiring the great literary treasures
of Great Britain. I have been accused in its public
prints of being the greatest offender. I have been
likened unto the ogre of ancient times. Perhaps it
is pertinent, therefore, to know the reason why
Americans are so anxious to obtain, at almost any
price, not only the choicest English books and manuscripts,
but the outstanding contemporary documents
that chronicle so faithfully and so inexorably
the political and literary history of England.</p>

<p>According to some of the English newspapers that
bewail the loss to England of her great monuments
of the past, it is a new thing, this interest in things
English on the part of the American public. On the
contrary, it has been going on, increasing in volume,
it is true, from about the year 1840. Before the
Civil War those two farsighted collectors, John
Carter Brown of Providence, Rhode Island, and
James Lenox of New York, were scouring England
for volumes relating to the early history of this
country, and incidentally gobbling up such rarities
as the first folio of Shakespeare. They were ably
assisted in their raids by an American who had
taken up his residence in London, Henry Stevens<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</span>
of Vermont, the Green Mountain Boy, who, among
the string of titles after his name, included the cryptic
letters, <span class="allsmcap">BLK BLD, ATHM CLB</span>, meaning “Blackballed
by the Athenæum Club!”</p>

<p>It is extremely gratifying to note the extraordinary
love of books persisting in one American family
for almost a century. In England the Huths and
many others have shown the tendency, the collector’s
instinct passed on from father to son for
many generations. In this country it is rare. The
remarkable exception, however, is evidenced by the
Browns of Providence. The great library founded
by John Carter Brown, with its glittering array of
superb volumes—among the finest in the world—bears
eloquent testimony to a continual devotion to
books and learning. The family of the original
founder has never for a moment flagged in its interest,
and the volumes added to the collection since
its establishment bear silent witness, unequaled in
America, of a loving regard for books.</p>

<p>In 1847, James Lenox brought to this country
from England the first Gutenberg Bible. The earliest
first folio of Shakespeare in America was purchased
in London about 1836. Since then they have flowed
to us in a constant and ever widening stream, until
to-day there are far more of them in the United
States than in the British Empire.</p>

<p>England need not complain, however, or consider
it such a serious loss, as some of her statesmen do.
She has within her narrow boundaries superb volumes
that America can never hope to possess. The
British Museum and the great libraries of Oxford<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</span>
and Cambridge, to say nothing of the wonderful
Spencer collection, now in the John Rylands Library
in Manchester, are treasure houses that luckily can
never be despoiled. They will be able to resist the
American invader and they will remain always at
the service of students and scholars. It is not generally
known that the libraries of England have left
no stone unturned to increase their already stupendous
hoards. The British Museum has added
constantly to its collections and to-day it is a greater
library, in many respects, than the Bibliothèque
Nationale, which long held the leadership. I think
it is actually the largest and most important library
in the world.</p>

<p>Under the able direction of Mr. Alfred W. Pollard,
formerly Keeper of Printed Books, the British Museum
acquired many books and manuscripts of great
intrinsic value, and it is to the extraordinary genius
of this man that the British public owes much.
Not only is he a bibliographer of remarkable ability,
but, when in charge of the books, he developed
the rare faculty of finding the very volumes that
would complete a certain series; he was, therefore,
ever on the alert to secure for the Museum the
things that were most needed. And this in the
face of American competition! As to the latter, it
is worthy of note that the late J. P. Morgan, and his
son as well, in forming their memorable collection,
whenever possible never bid against the Museum.
If the authorities particularly desired a certain manuscript
that belonged of right to the Museum, the
Morgans gracefully refrained from bidding.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</span></p>

<p>In fact, Englishmen have always taken a greater
pride in their national library than Americans in
theirs. Ever since its foundation, the British Museum
has received important bequests from collectors,
such as the superb gifts of George III and
the Honorable Thomas Grenville. Recently when it
was found that there was in the Museum no first
folio containing the portrait of Shakespeare in its
first state, several patriotic and discerning Englishmen
secured it for the Nation.</p>

<p>True, a few citizens have made noteworthy gifts
to our national library in Washington, but in the
main it has been sadly neglected. Americans have
given wisely and well to their own local foundations,
but the Congressional Library, which should be
the pride of every American, has never received
the encouragement it deserves. Dr. Herbert Putnam,
the gifted Librarian of Congress, is making
every effort to remedy this glaring defect in
our national armor. The Right Honorable Ramsay
MacDonald told me, during his recent visit to
Philadelphia, that an organized effort was being
made by friends of the British Museum to secure
the invaluable things that the Museum required.
Why not form a society of friends of the Library of
Congress, in order to purchase for it, while we have
still the opportunity, the many volumes of Americana
and the precious holograph documents that
bear directly upon our country’s history?</p>

<p class="caption">“JACK JUGGLER,” 1555—THE ONLY COPY KNOWN</p>
</div>

<p>It is a curious thing that rare books and the
precious things of the collector follow the flow of
gold. When the United States became the great
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</span>creditor nation, taking the place of England, at
least for the time being, it was but natural that the
various objects of art and interest should gravitate
to this side. During the last twenty years rare
books and literary documents have left the shores of
Albion at an alarming rate (for England). Most
of them are now in the private and public libraries
of the United States. I should hate to state how
much I assisted in this magic exodus.</p>

<p>England was the great offender in this same sort
of thing a century ago. It is the old threadbare
saying, which must have first been uttered by
Methuselah, that history repeats itself. In the
eighteenth century, Italy, France, and Spain were
complaining of the raids made on their artistic resources
by Englishmen, as England is complaining
of us to-day. The extraordinary increase in gold in
England during the Napoleonic Wars was responsible
for this. It was the era when the great collectors,
Richard Heber, Earl Spencer, the Duke of Roxburghe,
the Duke of Sussex, the Duke of Devonshire,
Sir Mark Sykes, and Robert Stayner Holford
were making the Grand Tour and buying in the
great emporiums in Rome and in Florence, in Paris
and Madrid, their choicest objects. It is true that
the Grand Tour has been the fashion in England
ever since the days of Chaucer and that great libraries
were formed in the fifteenth, sixteenth, and
seventeenth centuries, but it was during the late
eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries that the
greatest collections were made. In those days Sir
Richard Wallace could purchase the finest Watteau<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</span>
in Paris at the price of an etching to-day. The best
eighteenth-century paintings, drawings, bibelots, furniture,
so dear to the heart of Frenchmen, were
transferred from the Rue St. Honoré to Carlton
House Terrace, or to grace the drawing-rooms of
the elegant country homes of Great Britain.</p>

<p>The wheel of time, however, turns.</p>

<p>It is really unfortunate for England that she is
compelled now to give up some of her possessions.
No nation has a finer appreciation of great works
of the imagination. She receives payment for them,
it is true, but money is a thing that can be had;
it passes in cycles from one nation to another; a
rare book or a manuscript, if it once goes into a
public institution, can never be regained. Whether
England, to protect her historical and literary relics,
should make laws, as Italy has done, is no concern
of mine. In her wisdom she probably knows the
most expedient procedure. It is an economic as
well as cultural question, and of economics I am
glad to say I know absolutely nothing. There are,
however, masters of the subject in Great Britain;
they will probably solve this difficult problem.</p>

<p>The wisest among the collectors in England do
not look upon this exchange as a total loss to England.
I shall never forget my last conversation with
the late Sir George Holford in Dorchester House,
London, after I had purchased some of his dearest
possessions. He said, “The world is growing smaller—Englishmen
are great travelers; they can see these
very books some day in an American institution
far more readily than in the private collections in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</span>
England. I know, myself, how difficult it is to throw
open private homes to students. You recall as well
as I do that the finest library of English poetry was
never at the beck and call of students. I am glad
that most of it has gone to America where it will
be accessible to scholars of all nations.” Broadminded
men, like that erudite scholar, Lord Crawford,
know that these books will have tender and
loving care in America, and that they will be an
inspiration to our students.</p>

<p>We Americans have the enthusiasm of youth.
Perhaps the traditional Englishman has been so
accustomed to seeing about him the finest things of
art and literature that in the course of years he
becomes a trifle bored. Perhaps we shall also, in
the fullness of time, experience this, but at present
we are eager to fill the great libraries and edifices
in America with the rarest and most precious books.
In the East, and in the West as well, there are
enormous library buildings of the finest architectural
types. Alas, they have not the books to fill them.
The Free Library of Philadelphia has spent nearly
seven million dollars on a superb edifice. It will be
necessary to fill this building with suitable volumes.
The growth of American universities, unparalleled
in all time, calls for the apparatus of the student.
They must have the tools of their trade—books.
It is no wonder that there are not enough to go
round. The demand is greater than the supply.
Consequently prices will go steadily upward, and it
is well to secure them while we may.</p>

<p>It seems a pity that some Americans give such
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</span>enormous sums for library buildings and spend literally
nothing upon the volumes themselves. Books,
not edifices, make libraries. A friend of mine only
fifteen years ago spent four million dollars on a
superb library building; some are already complaining
that it is no longer up-to-date! Buildings pass;
they soon become obsolete. Books alone are everlasting.
“Men may come and men may go, but
books go on forever!” The late Mr. Huntington
used to say: “The ownership of a fine library is the
surest and swiftest way to immortality!”</p>

<p>I have to-day in my New York vault a collection
of early English manuscripts unequaled in any library
on this side of the Atlantic. It includes four manuscripts
of Chaucer, two of Gower’s <i>Confessio Amantis</i>,
several of Lydgate’s <i>Fall of Princes</i>, and the famous
manuscript of Occleve’s <i>Poems</i> with a contemporary
portrait of Chaucer. It will be impossible ever to
secure another assemblage like it, for it does not
exist. They will be appreciated after the last building
has tottered on its foundation.</p>

<p>The past fifty years has produced in this country
a group of book collectors equal to any that has
appeared in England or on the Continent, men well
in advance of their time, like the greatest book lover
of them all, Richard Heber. I always envied this
bibliomaniac his two possessions; as Sir Walter Scott
so neatly puts it, “Heber the magnificent, whose
library and cellar are so superior to all others in the
world!” Would that Americans could be as successful
gathering old vintages as old books! In this,
England has it all over us.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</span></p>
<p>It is melancholy to record that in the last few
months three of our most distinguished collectors
have passed away, each one of them possessing in
full measure the most extraordinary vision. I refer
first to Mr. Edward E. Ayer of Chicago, who was
one of the pioneers in making a serious collection of
books relating to the American Indian, which he
presented, before his death, to the Newberry Library
in Chicago. The late Mr. William A. White of
Brooklyn (of beloved memory) was among the
earliest of our collectors to gather the choice and
alluring volumes of the great Elizabethans. His
judgment was excellent and he had a vivid understanding
of this golden period, equaled by few
scholars. He did not hesitate to lend his finest
volumes to any student who showed an intelligent
interest in English literature.</p>

<p>I cannot speak at length of Mr. Henry E. Huntington.
I feel his loss too poignantly at the present
time. He was, without doubt, the greatest collector
of books the world has ever known. Without possessing
a profound knowledge of literature or of history,
his flair for fine books was remarkable. His taste
was sure, impeccable. The library at San Gabriel,
California, which houses his wonderful collections,
will be the Mecca of students for all time. No gift
to a nation or to a state can ever equal his. America
does not appreciate it to-day, but, as time spins its
web, and the world becomes better acquainted with
the Huntington treasures, this fact will be adequately
recognized.</p>

<p>I do not mean to imply that American collectors<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</span>
are forming great libraries and art galleries solely
for patriotic reasons, or for the good of their generation.
It is perhaps after all a secondary consideration
with them. Certainly it is not the first. Neither
is their motive the encouragement of scholarship or
of the arts. It is something more human. The
bump of acquisitiveness is strongly developed in our
collectors, and perhaps I know this as well as anyone.
They like to exhibit their treasures as other mortals
do, to show them to their envious friends with a
twinkle in their eyes and a certain amount of deviltry.
American amateurs, who have built railroads
and great suspension bridges, who have been financial
giants and captains of industry, must surely
possess the red blood that made them thus. Of
course they like to flaunt a folio of Ben Jonson or a
Keats’s <i>Poems</i> (with a presentation inscription!)
before the eyes of other collectors. In these ecstatic
moments they do not care a whit for the Nation or
for the people. But with the passing of years, with
the gradual oozing of the enthusiasm and candor of
youth, they think of the ultimate disposal of their
books. It is then, and then only, that the people
of America come into their own.</p>

<p>It is a wonderful and magnificent thing that the
gathering of books in this country is in the hands of
leaders of her industries, the so-called business kings,
and not in the hands of college professors and great
scholars. The latter, generally, in forming a collection
make a sad mess of it. The instinct of the collector,
the <i>heluo librorum</i> of Cicero, is entirely
different from that of the scholar. They are two
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</span>distinct and separate faculties: the acquisition of
knowledge and the gathering of books. Men to be
successful in either must have an entirely different
cosmos. Both are indispensable. It is paradoxical,
but true, that not a single great library in the world
has been formed by a great scholar.</p>

<p>Every year our collectors pitch their tents on the
fair and hospitable shores of Great Britain, where
they exchange their useless gold for ancient and
modern English books. The pleasant bookshops all
over England, Ireland, and Scotland welcome the
American visitors, who take home with them such
ingratiating little volumes as Herrick’s <i>Hesperides</i>
and Lovelace’s <i>Lucasta</i>. The supply of such charming
volumes has become well-nigh exhausted. Nowhere
can this migration be more clearly seen than
in the <i>Short-Title Catalogue of Books Printed in
England, Scotland, and Ireland, 1475-1640</i> issued
by The Bibliographical Society. This monumental
work has been compiled by A. W. Pollard, G. R.
Redgrave, and a host of the ablest English scholars.
A glance at its pages reveals the fact that there are
many important books of English dramatic poetry
of which no copy now remains in England. Take,
for instance, the second edition of <i>Hamlet</i>, published
in London, in 1604. It is really the first edition containing
the true text, as the first, of 1603, was a
pirated one, with inferior readings. Twenty-five
years ago three copies, all that exist, were in important
private libraries in England. To-day all
three are in America—in the Huntington Library,
in the Elizabethan Club at Yale University, and in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</span>
the private collection of Mr. H. C. Folger of New
York. The check-list shows that of many of the
most exquisite volumes of poetry and romance not
a single copy remains in the great country that saw
its birth. On the other hand, there are thousands of
books remaining in the British Museum, at the
Universities and Colleges, at Lambeth, at Edinburgh,
in the Patent Office, at Peterborough, at Winchester,
of which not a single example exists in any library in
the United States.</p>

<p>The situation, for England’s scholars, has certain
compensations. The books are really accessible in
this country. Following the procedure of the members
of the old Roxburghe Club, beautiful reprints
have been made by American collectors of various
great rarities and distributed to the libraries of
Great Britain. Heywood’s <i>King Edward the Fourth</i>,
1599, which exists in a single copy in the library of
Mr. C. W. Clark, has now been made in facsimile
by the courtesy of the owner and issued for the use
of students. Wager’s unique Interlude, <i>Enough is as
good as a Feast</i> (about 1565), has also been reprinted.
It was in Lord Mostyn’s library for many, many
years, quite out of the reach of most scholars. I
trust no one will infer from this that the great
English collectors bury their things and are niggardly
in offering their books and manuscripts to
the learned. On the contrary, the Duke of Devonshire,
Sir R. L. Harmsworth, and Mr. Thomas J.
Wise have always opened their doors to worthy
scholars.</p>

<p>It is a great mistake for England to think that
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</span>America is willing to pay mad prices for every
English book. When bidding around the board at
Sotheby’s the trade have often smiled when they
dropped a “hot one” on me. I shall never forget
when I bought a book for £640 in the Britwell sale
and someone kindly remarked, “Why, Richard Heber
gave two shillings for that very copy in 1826.”
Needless to say it made not the slightest difference
to me what he paid for it, I only knew that I was
getting a great book and that no price was too high
for it. Books of intrinsic worth, that exist in one
or two copies, cannot be measured in terms of shillings
and pence, or dollars and cents. Occasionally,
however, when bidding, for moral (or immoral!)
effect, I have dropped a common rarity on my competitors,
and they have paid twice what I thought
the book was worth. And I might have been mistaken
at that! It’s all in the game. It is also a
great mistake to think that when a book is knocked
down to an English bookseller it will remain within
the British Isles. There is nothing more fallacious
than that. At least fifty per cent of the purchases
of British dealers eventually wend their way to this
country.</p>

<p>Once I had a serious qualm when relieving Great
Britain of her cherished belongings. That was when
I purchased privately the Battle Abbey Cartularies,
the original documents of those valiant men who
came over with William the Conqueror. There were
hundreds of deeds and legal documents dating from
the Battle of Hastings in 1066, bound in ninety-nine
volumes. They were the very foundation of English<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</span>
history. It was with a feeling of genuine regret that
I saw them leave England forever. I hope in their
home in the New World they will have the tender
attention and respect they received in their former
abode in the west of England.</p>

<p>The muniment rooms in the great houses still
retain valuable documents of all kinds. A search
through the many volumes and calendars of papers
issued by the English Historical Manuscripts Commission
will reveal the wealth of material still remaining
in Great Britain. I remember only last
year looking with envious eyes upon the muniment<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</span>
chamber of a noble family. There were ancient
papers, rolls, parchments of all kinds, bound volumes
of letters, from floor to ceiling, some of which
had been in the same family for over eight hundred
years. What a treasure-trove for a student of the
social and political history of Great Britain! In
looking quite casually over the lot I found a paper
bearing the signature of John Milton; another of
Thomas Killigrew; a whole stack of Samuel Pepys!
My mouth began to water. I even thought if I
looked more thoroughly I might find one of William
Shakespeare—who knows? Professor Wallace found
several in the Public Record Office in London. The
famous <i>impresa</i> is in the Duke of Rutland’s collection
at Belvoir Castle. Why not find one hidden
away among these old musty records? It was,
however, with a sense of relief that I heard the
noble owner say to me: “You cannot carry these off,
Doctor Rosenbach. Thank God, they are entailed,
even my children’s children, if they fall on evil days,
will be unable to dispose of them.” Down in my
inmost soul I was delighted. Although I could never
possess them, it warmed the cockles of my heart to
hear the words that blasted my hopes forever. However,
there are compensations. I was invited to visit
the house any time I came to England, and to
examine at my leisure these entrancing documents.
My student days rushed back to me. How I should
have been rejoiced, in the old days, when I was
making original investigations into the beginnings of
the English Drama under the guidance of my beloved
teacher, Dr. Felix E. Schelling, to study these<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</span>
papers, with a chance of finding something that
would add, if only a trifle, to our knowledge of the
subject. I felt a renegade. I had deserted the halls
of learning for the bookshop; I had given up my
fellowship to enter a business that would, perhaps,
put money in my purse.</p>

<p>I did not, when at college, appreciate what a high
adventure the business was to prove, the excitement
and anxiety of the chase, and that I had a
better chance, a far greater opportunity, to unearth
unpublished documents, and uncover original source-material,
than ever I could have as an instructor
in English in some university. After twenty-five
years I am still of this opinion; although I sneakingly
hanker for the time when I can quietly return to
my early love, and carefully survey, without a
thought of their commercial value, the many interesting
things that have fallen to my collector’s bag.
Perhaps I have been of some help to other students,
who can investigate at their leisure the great mass
of material that I have been the instrument of placing
in their hands.</p>

<p>The study of English letters in the universities of
this country is also responsible for the persistent
demand for everything relating to the language and
literature of Great Britain. Theses on almost every
subject are being turned out regularly by candidates
for the Ph.D. degree. I would do almost anything
rather than be compelled to read most of them. I
plead guilty, however, to having written one myself,
long before I dreamed of entering the more diverting
sport of book hunting. The quality of some of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</span>the work done by our scholars is extremely high,
almost astounding, like Dr. Hotson’s bombshell describing
accurately, for the first time, the death of
Kit Marlowe. All the professors in the colleges and
all the students in the seminars (how I hate this word!)
are urging the university authorities to supply them
with books. And there is only one place to buy
them—England. It is no wonder, therefore, that
we are probably getting ourselves thoroughly disliked
on the other side by carrying off, like so many
lusty buccaneers, the sacred treasuries of English
thought. Admiral Drake, the “dragon” of Lope de
Vega, on his West Indian voyage looted the pearls
and emeralds of the New Empire, taking them back
to England to show to the Mighty Queen Elizabeth.
<i>Our</i> pirates are almost as ambitious. We go after far
more precious things, things that outwear time and
are not dependent on taste or fashion. The demand
for England’s books will not lessen; it will increase
with every decade. There are some English collectors,
like Sir R. L. Harmsworth, who are trying
gallantly to stem the tide. Others are steeling themselves
to heroic efforts to check the onrush, but
mere man cannot conquer an economic situation of
such dimensions. It will be impossible to check the
welling flood unless the Government comes to the
rescue.</p>

<p>As I have said before, the most sagacious among
Englishmen do not consider the matter a very serious
one. They look with equanimity upon the situation.
They really admire the pluck and spirit of our collectors,
for the English are sportsmen of the first
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</span>order. Recently I was speaking to one of them
about the Pierpont Morgan Library. He said how
marvelous it was that such a great collection should
be given to the public during the owner’s lifetime.
He knew of no gift to England of like magnitude.
I reminded him of the splendid Althorp collection
of Lord Spencer, given in 1892 by Mrs. John Rylands
to Manchester, which equals anything in this country.
We, however, have just begun. New collectors
and new libraries abound. New foundations, with
large sums for the purchase of books, are springing
into being. And yet some of the English (not the
wisest) say that the United States is a country where
the dollars count most. A libel, of course. In fact,
some of our amateurs are almost prodigal, nay,
quixotic in their use of money. I know one who gave
up a lucrative business in order to devote himself
to the purchase of old books. Bravo! Would that
there were more like him, not alone in this country,
but in England as well.</p>

<p>Following the financial centre, the book mart has
gradually shifted to New York. In a few years it
will be impossible to purchase the finest English
books in London. I have only recently sold to a
well-known English collector some volumes purchased
at the Britwell sale, not two years ago. I
can foresee the day when Englishmen, with the taste
and ability to buy, will be browsing in shops in
Philadelphia, in New Orleans, in Minneapolis, in
San Francisco, and taking their lucky finds back
with them to their old home.</p>

<p class="c large sp">THE COLLECTOR’S BEST BET</p>


<p>“<span class="smcap large">I don’t</span> give a tinker’s dam about the money value!”
We were working, my uncle Moses and I, in his
crowded bookshop on the second floor of the ancient
red brick building on Commerce Street in old Philadelphia.
Uncle Moses sat on top of a ladder before
some shelves, arranging his volumes, while I endeavored
to find an important document in his
paper-stuffed desk. An old colored man, a messenger,
had just staggered up the stairs to deliver
an enormous package. It proved to be, as usual, a
lot of crusty old books, and the last straw for me. I
looked despairingly at my uncle. Where were these
to find room? Each corner of the place, the chairs,
tables, and his desk, was already filled; and the
shelves, of course, were laden. I sighed. Why was
Uncle Moses forever buying, buying, buying, and
never—hardly ever—selling? And what was all
this newly arrived lot worth? It didn’t look like
much to me. It was then that he caught the trend
of my thought and boomed at me from the other end
of the room. I was, you must remember, only sixteen
at the time, and had yet to learn that a little knowledge
is a dangerous thing.</p>

<p>Uncle Moses quickly came down from his ladder
and gloated proudly over the newly arrived pile of
books. Then he fairly beamed as he turned to me.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</span>
“My boy,” he exclaimed, “‘Americana!’ That’s
the stuff to collect!” He picked up a volume, opened
to the yellowed title page, and read aloud: “Here is
a <i>Discovery of the Barmudas, otherwise called the Isle
of Devils</i>. It is the work of Silvester Jourdain, 1610.
Americana! Even Shakespeare knew the fascination
of it. It was this little book which in part inspired
him to write <i>The Tempest</i>!” He turned to light
his old meerschaum pipe, and as he did so, his battered,
picturesque top-hat, which had stood crowded
between a row of books and the wall, fell to the
floor. I felt a savage glow of delight at this mishap.
But Uncle Moses ignored it. He was on a
favorite subject, and he had his most appreciative
audience: me. Although I had not been born with
a caul over my face, he felt I had second sight—for
books. And he delighted to catch my imagination
as a fair wind takes a sail, filling it now this way,
now that. It was something of a relaxation for him.</p>

<p>“Heaps of people,” he continued, “can’t seem to
get it into their heads that there is just as much
drama in the history of our own country as in any
of the Old World empires. Hasn’t my friend Prescott
made the conquerors of Mexico and Peru live
before our eyes? Talk about William the Conqueror!
What is the matter with Columbus, Cortés, and
Pizarro?” I was thrilled now—thrilled to the marrow
when he talked like that. And with gratification
he watched me as I stood there transfixed.</p>

<p>“Think of the capture of the last Inca! Why, it is
far more exciting than the Battle of Agincourt. It
outweighs even Shakespeare’s graphic description in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</span>
<i>King Henry V</i>.” He stopped for a moment, his penetrating
dark eyes sparkling with excitement. “But
it is not only the battles, the political intrigues,” he
went on, “the early history of our great industries
is just as important. For instance, the old forty-niners’
records of the first discovery of gold in
California, the beginning of the steel mills, the first
railroad prospectuses, all this country’s gigantic
domestic activities! My boy, I envy you the years
ahead in which you will discover for yourself the
color, the romance, the mystery of your country’s
history!”</p>

</div></div>

<p>Time has proved to me that my uncle prophesied
well when he said that Americana would have a
unique and splendid place in the book world. And
although his prophecies were made many years ago,
it is not too late to-day to start collecting Americana.
But, of course, to-morrow it may be. They get scarcer
every day; they will never be any cheaper; and of one
thing you may be sure: the value of Americana will
increase with the rising fortunes of America.</p>

<p>So many of the books and documents on which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</span>
history is based have been absorbed by public libraries
and by historical societies that the available
source material itself has dwindled. In the old days,
when such friends of Moses Polock as James Lenox,
Doctor Brinley, old Menzies, John Carter Brown,
Brayton Ives, Henry C. Murphy, James Carson
Brevoort, and countless others were enslaved by an
inordinate passion for books, they did not have to
go far afield to find the things that delighted their
souls. The most precious relics were to be found
almost at their doorsteps. If they were in Philadelphia,
it was to the bookstalls along Second Street
they went; in New York, to the drowsy old shops of
lower Broadway. In these and other places serious-minded
young collectors—can’t you see them in
their stovepipe hats, their high, tight collars, and
enormous black satin cravats?—searched in leisurely
mood through the untouched treasure-hoards
of Americana. Indeed, those were the days when
you could pick up Smith’s <i>History of Virginia</i> for
fifty dollars almost as easily as you can secure to-day
the latest novel of a popular writer.</p>

<p>But, budding collectors, do not despair. Who
knows but there are nuggets hidden this very minute,
at your hand? Hidden only because you do not
realize their potential value. Things which are considered
valueless to-day may soar high in favor in
the near future. You know that our grandfathers,
not to mention their sisters and their cousins and
their aunts, could have bought the autograph letters
of such historical figures as Lincoln, Grant, Lee, and
Jefferson Davis for a few dollars during the years<span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</span>
that immediately followed the Civil War. And it
was not until twenty years later that collectors began
to gather together everything they could find concerning
Lincoln, for it was not until then that he became
a figure permanently great in the thoughts of the
people. His merest pen scratch took on a definite
value, which has increased steadily since then.</p>

<p>The World War has now been over for nearly nine
years. Mementos of the conflict which are to-day
tolerated merely for their sentimental value will be
highly esteemed twenty years from now. They will
be coveted objects, not only in the eyes of the collector,
but to the perhaps more discerning ones of
the historian as well.</p>

<p>The way of the transgressor is not much harder
than that of the enthusiastic biblio-fiend. The only
difference is that the latter is sure of his eventual
reward. Not a day passes that some man or woman
does not appear in my library, either in Philadelphia
or in New York, to offer me some curious and interesting
book, tract, or letter relating to the history
of this country. Very often I have to pay heavily for
certain desirable documents. But, like my uncle
Moses, I don’t give a tinker’s dam about the money
value. I hope I am a cheerful giver when, as a result
of my purchase, I discover material hitherto unknown
to the historians of our country.</p>

HIS THIRTY-FIRST BIRTHDAY BY THE REV. DR.<br>
GREEN, FEBRUARY 22, 1763, AT TRURO, VIRGINIA</p>
</div>

<p>When my brother Philip was in Spain last year he
spent several weeks touring through the picturesque
towns and villages of Granada. Can you imagine
his surprise and joy, when one day he stopped at an
ancient monastery and bought a bundle of old papers
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</span>which contained a most valuable and interesting
document—the original manuscript signed by the
Emperor Charles V, wherein Hernando Cortés,
Adelantado of the Indies, was appointed Knight of
the Order of Santiago. As this order was an honor
considered at that time the most distinguished and
aristocratic in all Castile, it naturally showed Cortés
in a light hitherto unnoted by historians. To-day
this magnificent document is in the collection of my
dear friend, Mr. H. V. Jones, in Minneapolis. Mr.
Jones in a surprisingly short time has formed one of
the finest libraries of books relating to this country.</p>

<p>From the very day that Christopher Columbus
discussed his great project with Queen Isabella, the
stream of American history has at all times flowed
tumultuously, and never without color and romance.</p>

<p>When Columbus returned to Spain from the New
World, he stopped on February 14, 1493, at Santa
Maria, one of the islands of the Azores, probably to
take water. Four days before this he had encountered
the most terrific storm of his great voyage, and was
convinced that he, his men, and his vessels must
perish. Now Columbus realized in his heart that he
was going back to Spain with news of a discovery
second in importance to no other. And when it
seemed that his ship might sink at any moment, he
set to work to make a record of his mighty adventure,
hoping that by some will of the Fates it would
not be lost to posterity. So, on February fourteenth,
he carefully prepared as complete an account of his
marvelous voyage as was possible under the circumstances.
He wrote the details of his journey on a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</span>
stout piece of parchment, wrapped it carefully in a
piece of waterproof cloth, then placed it in an iron-bound
barrel and threw it into the raging ocean.
But the Fates were kinder to Columbus than to this
account made in a time of stress.</p>

<p>Certainly this, the first record of America, written
by the brave hand of Columbus, would be the most
precious relic in all the chronicles of our country.
Alas, that it never has been found! And if I thought
there were one chance in a million of finding it I
would take my power boat, the First Folio, and
cruise in the neighborhood of the Azores forever!</p>

<p>It is also curious that another letter, which Columbus
wrote the day after he arrived at Santa Maria to
his friend Luis de Santangel, has never been found.
Nor has another and more concise account of his experiences,
which he wrote in an exultant vein to the
<i>Reyes Catolicos</i>, Ferdinand and Isabella, immediately
upon landing in Lisbon, ever seen the light of day.</p>

<p>Every school child is taught the date of Columbus’s
arrival at Palos, March 15, 1493. On that very same
day he dispatched two letters to the Court, then sitting
at Barcelona. Another, much briefer and more
to the point, he sent to another friend, Gabriel Sanchez,
then the royal treasurer.</p>

<p>About one month after Columbus returned to
Spain, a second letter which he indited to Luis de
Santangel was printed on two leaves, folio size. Evidently
these were sent out in all directions and must
have been in great demand. You can well realize
that the excitement created by the publication of his
stupendous discovery was tremendous. And yet it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</span>
is very strange that but one copy of the entire edition
has survived. These two leaves are the actual
cornerstone of American history. They are worth
not only their weight in radium many times over,
but, to the book lover, his very chances of Paradise!
They are now, I am proud to state, not in some musty
old castle of Spain, but in the Lenox Foundation, a
part of the New York Public Library, in the heart
of New York City. There, if you show the appropriate
desire, you may see it any day. Some authorities
think this letter was printed by Rosenbach, one
of the earliest Spanish printers, and probably one of
my forbears. The old fool! Why didn’t he save at
least one copy for his descendants?</p>

<p>Of the second edition of this letter, with the Fates
still pursuing, there is likewise but one remaining
copy. To-day it reposes in a very safe place, the
Ambrosian Library in Milan. The present Pope,
Pius XI, who should be the patron saint of all modern
book collectors, was first the assistant in this library,
and finally the librarian. In bygone years his knowledge
of books and his infectious enthusiasm inspired
many a bookman. How it must have delighted him
to have this great letter of Columbus in his care!</p>

<p>Edition after edition of the first Columbus letter
soon appeared. The news was so astounding that
all who could read wanted to see for themselves the
discoverer’s own description of this amazing new
land. Four editions appeared in Rome, two in Basle,
three in Paris, and one in Antwerp. These were all
published in Latin or Italian. Florence printed the
news four separate times; strange to relate, the first<span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</span>
edition in German did not appear until 1497. But
the Germans enhanced their edition with one of the
most amusing woodcuts I have ever seen. It is a
picture of the King of Spain and Columbus, who
seem to be explaining their great achievement (doubtless
as an offering) to Jesus Christ. There were six
copies of it known until recently, three of which are
in this country: one in the Lenox Library, one in
the John Carter Brown collection at Providence,
Rhode Island, and one in the safekeeping of the
Huntington Library. But only last year, when I
visited an old library in the west of England, the
private collection of a friend of mine, I had a curious
experience.</p>

<p>It was at that hour which is neither day nor night,
and the dressing gong for dinner had sounded. I
put my hand out in the half light to steady myself
after “tea,” and touched—not the <i>fille de chambre</i>,
as Sterne relates in his <i>Sentimental Journey</i>, but the
edges of something projecting from a shelf of an old
bookcase. I had the strange feeling of an omen about
to be realized, one of those peculiar premonitions
women are always boasting of. I loosened the books
on either side, drew out the object, and went soberly
to the nearest window, to find that I had not one but
two copies of this German Columbus letter! That
was enough to stagger anyone. One is now in the
collection of that great lover and connoisseur of books,
Mr. Grenville Kane, of Tuxedo Park, New York, who
is now the <i>doyen</i> of American collectors; the other
is cherished by my old friend Mr. H. V. Jones.</p>

<p>The story of this country unfolds itself like some<span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</span>
gorgeous panorama as you look through the books
which chronicle the stirring times of the early adventurers.
Who wouldn’t choose to hear tales from
actual eyewitnesses, rather than read them rehashed
in a fusty history book? The principal performers
in the great historical dramas have themselves told
us stories of daring, of bravery, of great disasters
and victories. Such men were Amerigo Vespucci;
Waldseemüller, the famous geographer, whose <i>Cosmographiæ
Introductio</i>, published at St. Dié in 1507,
was the first book which gave the name, America, to
the New World; Peter Martyr, the first historian
of the Indies, who described the voyages of his
friends and contemporaries, Columbus, Vasco da
Gama, Magellan, Cabot, and Vespucci. Martyr’s
<i>Decades of the New World</i> should quicken the pulse of
every lover of American history, for it contains most
of the knowledge we have of the very earliest “inventions,”
as they were called.</p>

<p>Elsewhere I have told of my purchase of the Ellsworth
copy of the Gutenberg Bible. Included in the
lot with it was one of the earliest charts showing the
east coast of America. It dates around 1501-02. I
was present at the sale of this famous map, known
as the King-Hamy chart, when it brought $17,600,
and was one of the unhappy underbidders thereon.
I thought it was lost to me and my heirs forevermore.
However, when the Ellsworth collection was
sold, I radioed my bid from mid-Atlantic and secured
it.</p>

<p>Early portolano charts, as these first navigators’
maps are called, are extremely interesting. They<span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</span>
indicate, step by step, the latest discoveries as they
were made. You can see for yourself, if you follow
the development from the first faint coast lines
on the earliest charts to the recognizable later outlines,
the wonderful progress made by various explorers
in less than a century. Every year new ports, new
bays, new islands, new harbors of refuge are seen.
The first mariners in the waters of the New Islands,
as they were called, sent their original and very
rough working charts, made from the actual observations
of pilots, to the great cartographers in Spain
and Italy. Those men were really artists. Baptista
Agnesi was one of the most famous of the chart
makers. He and his colleagues all produced beautiful,
illuminated atlases containing elaborately decorated
maps, gorgeously bound, which they sold to the
great princes and merchants of the day. The maps
were much in demand as table books for the libraries
of wealthy men.</p>

<p>But there are very few of the first drafts of the
early maps left. The rolls of parchment which
originated in the rough pilot house of an early sailing
vessel were often damaged by ocean spray and rats’
teeth; under such conditions they could last but a
short while. Probably not five, altogether, survive.
Yet lately I have had the unexampled good fortune
to obtain two actual pilots’ charts; the first one was
used on the voyage of Cortés, the other must have
accompanied Pizarro on his magnificent conquest of
Peru. The former shows but the barest outline of
the coasts of the two Americas; the second, only
fifteen years later, presents a much more detailed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</span>
diagram of the shores, indicating the advance in
geographical knowledge during this brief period.</p>

<p>Probably the two finest and most highly finished
examples of the map-maker’s art are two table
books: the Spitzer chart in the John Carter Brown
Library at Providence and the famous Jacques Cartier
atlas in the collection of the late Henry E. Huntington.
Another magnificent collection of portolano
charts is in the library of the Hispanic Society in
New York City, formed by the great student and
collector, Mr. Archer M. Huntington.</p>

<p>Now the young book enthusiast, if he has a limited
amount of money, must not feel out of the running
when he sees that many of the rarer examples of
Americana are beyond his means. Indeed, the discriminating
collector seeks not only the great and
costly pieces, such as Richard Hakluyt’s <i>Divers
Voyages Touching the Discoverie of America</i>, 1582
(complete with both maps); Thomas Hariot’s <i>Briefe
and True Report of the New Found Land of Virginia</i>,
1588; Francis Drake’s <i>West Indian Voyage</i>, 1589;
or that wonderful collection, the most elaborate
ever compiled about America, known as De Bry’s
<i>Voyages</i>. Of course, everyone would like to secure
these descriptions of the early discoveries. Such
fascinating accounts as those bequeathed to posterity
by Fray Bartolomé de las Casas, the first real historian
of the Spanish conquest, and his successor, Cieza
de Leon—these will always be coveted, it goes
without saying.</p>

<p>It is the little things, however, that I think most
appealing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</span></p>

<p>For instance, within the past few months I found
and purchased the first tailor bill in the New World.
It was the original invoice sent to Hernando de Soto
in 1536, several years before he made his momentous
discovery of the Mississippi River. The bill was
dated from Lima, the City of the Kings, which had
only been founded in 1535. There were forty items
listed: bolts of the finest black velvets and satins,
yards and yards of scarlet taffeta for linings. Can
you see the great <i>conquistador</i> flashing his way
through some primeval jungle, clad like the king’s
courtier that he was, even in the wilderness? But
to me the most startling thing about this bill of
$1400 for one month’s raiment is that it was—receipted!
How the tailors on Fifth Avenue would
gloat over this relic of their earliest predecessor!
Perhaps some way will be found to make a facsimile
of the first receipted weapon of their trade. It should
be hung in every tailoring establishment along the
Avenue as a gentle reminder to tardy patrons.
Although the clothes and the tailor who made them,
as well as the customer who wore them, have all
long since evaporated, Juan Ruiz, the tailor’s name,
will live. It is forever connected with the distinguished
name of Hernando de Soto, the discoverer of
the Mississippi.</p>

<p>Virginia in the early days included practically all
the English possessions in America. Consequently
New England was part of Virginia. The first books
relating to this English colony in the New World
are all of abounding interest. The history of settlements
such as these, of fierce and frequent fights<span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</span>
with Indians, or the gentler tale of Raleigh and his
pipe of tobacco, reads like a dime novel. Of course
all these descriptions are entrancingly rare and the
acquisition of any one of them will make a dent in
the most astute pocketbook. As a rule, these tracts
were ephemeral publications not unlike much of the
pamphlet literature that is issued to-day. They
were small quarto volumes, sometimes comprising
only eight or ten leaves. After they were read they
doubtless were cast into the seventeenth-century
equivalent of the waste-paper basket, and that is
why so few are in existence to-day. The cherished
survivors have been preserved because they were
bound together in volumes at the time they were
issued.</p>

<p>Recently, in the library of an old London house,
I came across one of these precious collections containing
twenty-three of the rarest pamphlets relating
to America. Bound therein were such collectors’
darlings as Brereton’s <i>Brief and true Relation of the
Discovery of the Northern Part of Virginia</i>, 1602;
James Rosier’s <i>A True Relation of the most prosperous
Voyage made this present year 1605 in the Discovery
of the Land of Virginia</i>, published in London
in 1605. And embedded in the centre of the volume,
like a choice nugget, was the first work of the redoubtable
Captain John Smith, entitled <i>A True Relation
of such Occurrences and Accidents of Noate as
hath hapned in Virginia</i>, London, 1608.</p>

<p>“Have you any other books or pamphlets relating
to America?” I asked the distinguished owner
after I had purchased this volume, which was worth<span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</span>
many thousands of pounds. He thought for so long
before answering that I was afraid he had nothing.
When I had almost given up hope, he said suddenly,
“Would you be interested in a presentation copy of
Captain Smith’s <i>Generall Historie of Virginia</i>, 1624?”</p>

<p>“What are you trying to do? Pull my leg?”</p>

<p>“No, really,” he replied. “Here it is.” He walked
the length of the great room to an enormous bookcase
with glass doors, and tenderly extracted a tall
slim book. The arms of England were impressed in
gold upon the covers. To say I was astounded is to
express it mildly. And there, covering the whole flyleaf
in front of the beautifully engraved title page,
was the only known specimen of handwriting of the
celebrated “Governour and Admirall of New England,”
as Captain Smith was dubbed thereon. Since
this dedication is entirely unknown, I give it here
to be printed for the first time:—</p>

<p>Smith’s <i>Virginia</i> is in many respects the standard
example of English Americana. The narrative is
trippingly told, and if Captain Smith exaggerates
and invents, so much the better! He is the prime
storyteller among historians. Were he alive to-day
he would probably prove himself the greatest scenario
writer of all time, especially if he wrote colorful
thrillers filled with action such as the Pocahontas
episode. Here it is in part:—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The Queene of Appomatuck was appointed to bring
him [Smith] water to wash his hands, and another brought
him a bunch of feathers, instead of a Towell to dry them;
having feasted him after their best barbarous manner
they could, a long consultation was held, but the conclusion
was, two great stones were brought before Powhatan;
then as many as could layd hand on him, dragged him to
them, and thereon laid his head, and being ready with
their clubs, to beate out his braines, Pocahontas the Kings
dearest daughter, when no intreaty could prevaile, got
his head in her armes, and laid her owne upon his to save
him from death: whereat the Emperour was contented he
should live to make him hatchets, and her bells, beads,
and copper....</p>
</div>

<p>I myself like best his touching note about the first
white child born in British America:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>And the 18th [August, 1587] Ellinor the Governours
daughter, and wife to Ananias Dare, was delivered of a
daughter in Roanoak; which, being the first Christian
there borne, was called Virginia.</p>
</div>

<p>The early history of the settlement of New England
according to its present bounds is perhaps more
austere than the narrative of Ponce de Leon in
Florida or the exploits of Jacques Cartier in New
France. Nevertheless, the story contains many soul-stirring
incidents. It is as chock-full of romantic relations
as the <i>Thousand and One Nights</i>. No one
realized this more clearly and beautifully than
Nathaniel Hawthorne. A dear friend of mine and
one of the most discriminating and earnest collectors
in this country, whose judgment in any matter of
taste is final, owns the Hawthorne family copy of
<i>William Hubbard’s Narrative of the Troubles with the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</span>
Indians in New England</i>, printed in Boston by John
Foster, 1677. It is in its original sheep binding.
This book had been the cherished property of the
Hawthorne family of Salem for two hundred and
fifty years. The name of the first emigrant founder
of the family is at the top of the title page: “William
Hawthorne, Senior, his booke, 1677.” It is he who
is described in the introduction to <i>The Scarlet Letter</i>
as “grave, bearded, sable-cloaked ... with his Bible
and his sword....”</p>

<p>The second owner, his son, and not less famous as
the notorious witch judge of Salem, placed his autograph
at the bottom of the title page: “John Hathorne
his booke.” The book next descended to his son,
who wrote on the flyleaf: “Joseph Hathorne His
Book 1739-40.” And so it went from father to son
for many more generations, finally becoming the
possession of Nathaniel Hawthorne. After his name,
in which he reinserted the original <i>w</i>, he wrote,
“given him by his Kinswoman, Miss Susan Ingersoll,
1838.” Few old books of intrinsic value have a
record of ownership as direct and interesting as this.
From Major William Hawthorne, the founder of the
family, who led more than one expedition against
the Indians, to Nathaniel Hawthorne, the gentlest
of men, is indeed a far cry.</p>

<p>New England is fortunate in possessing two interesting
and authentic manuscript narratives of its
earliest history. Governor Winthrop’s Journal or
<i>Historie of New England</i> is one, and William Bradford’s
<i>Historie of Plimouth Plantation</i> the other.
Both, although written in a somewhat formal manner,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</span>
contain the most realistic description of life in the
colonies. Probably the two most important printed
books of this period are George Mourt’s <i>A Relation
or Journal of the Beginning and Proceedings of the
English Plantation settled at Plimouth in New England</i>,
London, 1622, and the first published history
of Massachusetts, William Wood’s <i>New England’s
Prospect</i>, London, 1634.</p>

<p>The first work published in English about New
York is entitled <i>The Second Part of the Tragedy of
Amboyna</i>, 1653. It is really a controversial pamphlet
in which the early Dutch colonists were accused of
trying to induce the Indians to murder the English
settlers who had come down from New England.
But the first true history of New York was Daniel
Denton’s <i>A Brief Description of New York First
Called New Netherlands</i>, 1670. In those days it was
the fashion to malign the Dutch, and families such as
the De Peysters and the Van Rensselaers were not so
prominent socially as their descendants are to-day.</p>

<p>The first account of Pennsylvania was written by
none other than William Penn himself, and published
in London in 1681. Although Penn had never seen
this country at the time, he wrote a most glowing
account of it, proving that the press-agent bacillus
was even then alive. This wonderful Quaker wanted
colonists to develop the grant which was given him
in settlement of the Crown’s debt to his father. It
is no wonder that in a virulent tract the better classes
of England showed their distaste for his business
activities, which they considered unbecoming to his
religion and his position. That naughty little pamphlet
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</span>is entitled <i>William Penn’s Conversion from a
Gentleman to a Quaker</i>!</p>

<p>One could dwell for an indefinite time upon books
and tracts dealing with the fascinating events of
early life in the colonies. Every leaflet printed in
this country from the time the first press was established
in Cambridge in 1640 until the year 1700 is of
value; after that date they must relate to historical
events or prominent personages to prove their worth.
Every early newspaper printed in America, every
broadsheet, every autograph letter or manuscript
containing real meat for the historian, is of value.</p>

<p>Many youthful collectors approach those older
ones who have been through the mill, asking for
tips. In the beginning they all believe there is some
secret which may be learned by diligent questioners.
Well, here is a secret, but it is an open one. If the
young biblio-fiend will search in the older towns of
the thirteen original colonies, he is bound in time to
turn up unknown treasures! I only wish I had the
time to do some quiet delving myself.</p>

<p>Do not forget that all material relating to the
history of the West is just as important as that of
the Eastern states, often more picturesque, and perhaps
even more romantic. Take, for instance, the
first book published in San Francisco in 1848-49.
It will in time be just as valuable as the first book
printed in Philadelphia in 1685. The three thousand
miles between the two cities, one on the Atlantic
Coast, the other on the Pacific, show the tide of
settlement of our country. It was only seventy-five
years ago that the first guidebooks were published<span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</span>
in Eastern cities, showing ways to travel to the Far
West, giving tables of distances and other information
for the emigrant. They were the road maps of
the stalwart pioneers who packed wife, children, and
chattels into a covered wagon and took the shortest
route to that part of the uninhabited plains which
they hoped would be their El Dorado.</p>

<p>All these are important stones in the foundation
of history. There are books printed within the past
twenty-five years which contain important source
material concerning the particular parts of the
country they describe. Some of these books bring
very high prices even to-day. What would Zenas
Leonard have thought had he known that his simple
little narrative, published at Clearfield, Pennsylvania,
in 1839, would in less than ninety years be battled
for in the auction rooms? This tale of his adventures of
five years’ trapping for furs and trading with Indians
in the Rocky Mountains is sought to-day as a most
desirable addition to a library of Americana. I saw
a copy sell at auction not long ago for $1700.</p>

<p>Although the printed books relating to America
are fascinating and instructive, autographs make the
incidents they describe alive and vivid for us. Every
true collector is strongly moved when he sees the
autograph of a great personage in his country’s history.
And, after all, the printed word must have a
certain coldness and formality. Indeed, it is perhaps
a part of its beauty. But words written down by
the actor himself as he helps to complete the drama
are personal things which unfailingly appeal to the
imagination.</p>

<p>No wonder collectors everywhere are doing their
utmost to uncover from the débris of a past age
autograph letters relating to the Revolution, and
particularly to the fifty-six signers of the Declaration
of Independence. The highest auction price of any
autograph was paid on March sixteenth of this year
for a Button Gwinnett signature. When the auctioneer
of the Anderson Galleries in New York City
knocked it down to me for $51,000, I was tickled
to death. It was the only 1776 Button Gwinnett
letter about national affairs that had ever been sold.
This particular autograph is now the most famous
one in the world, and at the price paid figures about
$3600 a letter. It is a strange commentary on the
vagaries of fame that you can buy a signature of
Napoleon for ten dollars a letter. During the last
six months quotations on Button Gwinnett Preferred
have jumped sixty-five per cent.</p>

<p>A shocking tale is told of the rapid rise of American
autograph material. A friend of mine decided to sell
at auction his magnificent collection of letters of
signers, famous generals, Presidents of the United
States, and other historical characters. He had bought
them not many years ago. When the evening of the
sale arrived Mr. G—— was there with his wife. He
carried a catalogue marked with the cost of each
item. The first number in the sale, which cost him
$45, brought $250; the next, for which he had paid
$80, fetched $800, and so on, until about fifteen items
were sold.</p>

<img src="images/fig84.jpg" alt="letter">
<p class="caption">LETTER SIGNED BY BUTTON GWINNETT, BOUGHT FOR<br>
$51,000</p>
</div>

<p>His wife, who was watching his catalogue over his
shoulder, and who could hardly contain herself any
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</span>longer, exclaimed, “My, Doctor R is going strong
to-night. Why, that letter which just sold for $1650
you bought from him only a little while ago for $360.
I feel like laughing out loud.”</p>

<p>“If you do,” her husband threatened, “I’ll take
you by the hair, drag you outside, and strangle you!”
At this his wife was quiescent for a few minutes.
The prices were still mounting. She then wrote on a
card which she passed to Mr. G——: “I can smile,
can’t I?”</p>

<p>“That goes for smiling, too,” replied her husband.</p>

<p>About five years ago I was especially interested in
all material relating to Paul Revere and his celebrated
ride. In the midst of my researches a gentleman
called upon me one day and showed me a series of
volumes which contained most important papers
relating to the Revolutionary period. On looking
through them I was amazed to run across the following
outstanding document, which is dated Cambridge,
April 29, 1775, ten days after Revere’s
famous exploit. It is as follows:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>This may certify that the bearer Mr. Paul Revere is
a messenger to the Committee of Safety and that all dispatch
and assistance be given him in all instances that
the business of the Collony may be facilitated.</p>

<p class="r"><span class="smcap">Jos. Warren, Chairn</span></p>
</div>

<p>Poor General Warren, who signed Revere’s commission
as messenger, was killed a few weeks later
at the Battle of Bunker Hill.</p>

<p>Although I freely admit that this letter belongs in
the archives of New England, you may be sure I
keep it well within my reach. I don’t care to have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</span>
those doughty New England historians, such as Dr.
Charles L. Nichols, Clarence S. Brigham, George
Parker Winship, and Lawrence C. Wroth, come
pouncing down as a mighty host and demand it of
me.</p>

<p>It is surprising how things fall the collector’s way
in series. As I have related in a previous article, I
have the only certified copy of the Declaration of
Independence that is outside the public archives.
But I always hankered after a letter written by a
signer who was an eyewitness on that July Fourth,
one hundred and fifty years ago—a letter telling
about the actual signing of the Declaration of Independence.
For twenty-two long years I searched for
it, and was delightfully shocked one day to read in
an auction catalogue a description of the following
letter by Cæsar Rodney, the signer from Delaware,
to his brother, Thomas Rodney, dated Philadelphia,
July 4, 1776. You may be sure I gobbled up this
letter.</p>

<p>Rodney wrote:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I arrived in Congress tho detained by thunder and
rain time enough to give my voice in the matter of Independence.
It is now determined by the thirteen United
Colonies without even one desenting Colony. We have
now got through with the whole of the Declaration and
ordered it to be printed so that you will soon have the
pleasure of seeing it. Hand bills of it will be printed and
sent to the armies, cities, county towns, etc.—to be
published or rather proclaimed in form....</p>
</div>

<p>I have always been peculiarly interested in anything
which related to the origin and history of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</span>
American flag, and I have always wanted, with my
infernal and almost feminine curiosity, to find out
when it was first raised. I had found references at
various times to its appearance sometime during the
second year of the Revolution, but could not discover
the exact date in any of the items of Americana
which I had collected. One day about nine
years ago I was reading a manuscript, <i>Journal of
the most Material Occurrences proceeding the Siege
of Fort Schuyler</i>, by William Colbreath. As I turned
the leaves of the manuscript my attention was
arrested by the following:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Augt 3d [1777] Early this morning a Continental
Flagg made by the Officers of Col. Gansevoorts Regiment
was hoisted and a Cannon Levelled at the Enemies Camp
was fired on the Occasion....</p>
</div>

<p>This is the only authoritative account known of the
first raising of the American battle flag, and it was
on this day that the British troops saw for the first
time the new standard of America.</p>

<p>Some years ago I received a seductive appeal from
a Boston collector. He had purchased some wonderful
books which, though they filled his shelves, depleted
his purse. And yet he could still write, “Dear
Doctor: Please tempt me!” How often do I wish
the sirens would tempt me, especially if the little
charmers were in the form of autograph letters and
manuscripts relating to Lincoln and his time. Believe
me, I’ll never be too old to be caught by their
allure.</p>

<p>Of all periods in American history, none is more
inspiring and dramatic than that of the Civil War.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</span>
It is one of the most kaleidoscopic times in all history,
with three men of outstanding character in it,
Abraham Lincoln, Ulysses S. Grant, and Robert E.
Lee. Any scrap of material relating to them is
bound to increase in value. Lincoln letters to-day
are rarer than Washington’s, and nearly all of his
great pieces are written in his own hand.</p>

<p>Of course, collectors prefer what are known as
A. L. S. (autograph letter signed) instead of the
L. S., or letter merely signed by Lincoln, that is,
not in his handwriting but written by an official
clerk. Thank God, those were the days before the
typewriter, and every letter contains an intimate
appeal which the machine can never give.</p>

<p>That puts me in mind of a good one.</p>

<p>About three months ago a lady came to see me in
New York and asked to be shown some Lincoln
letters. I used the cataloguer’s phrase and spoke of
holographs, fair copies, A. L. S., and the usual rigmarole
of the collector. I then exhibited before her
interested eyes a letter of Lincoln’s which I treasured,
because it is perhaps the only one in which Lincoln
swore. It was addressed to John T. Stuart, his law
partner, dated Vandalia, Illinois, February 14, 1839,
and he refers to a man named Ewing as follows:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Ewing won’t do anything. He is not worth a damn.</p>

<p class="r1">Your friend,</p>

<p class="r"><span class="smcap">A. Lincoln</span></p>
</div>

<p>The lady exclaimed, “I know what you mean by
A. L. S. I did not understand you at first. You
mean Abraham Lincoln swore!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</span></p>

<p>Americana really is the collector’s best bet. I can
never be too grateful to Uncle Moses for his advice
to me. I have kept zealously almost every piece relating
to the Civil War, and I think that I have
succeeded in the past thirty years in gathering the
finest collection relating to it, except the national
collection in Washington. I have such remarkable
Lincoln documents as his first draft of the Emancipation
Proclamation, entirely in his autograph,
written six months before it was finally put into
operation on January 1, 1863; his famous Baltimore
address, in which he gives his celebrated definition
of liberty; the original manuscript of his speech
about the formation of the Republican Party; and
many other pieces of the greatest historical significance,
which can never come a collector’s way again.</p>

<p>I cannot resist giving Lincoln’s speech on the
party of which he was the most illustrious leader:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Upon those men who are, in sentiment, opposed to
the spread and nationalization of slavery, rests the task
of preventing it. The Republican Organization is the
embodiment of that sentiment; though as yet, it by no
means embraces all the individuals holding that sentiment.
The party is newly formed, and in forming, old
party ties had to be broken, and the attractions of party
pride, and influential leaders, were wholly wanting. In
spite of all differences, prejudices, and animosities, its
members were drawn together by a paramount common
danger. They formed and maneuvered in the face of the
disciplined enemy, and in the teeth of all his persistent
misrepresentations. Of course, they fell far short of gathering
in all of their own. And yet, a year ago, they stood
up, an army over thirteen hundred thousand strong.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</span>
That army is, today, the best hope of the nation, and of
the world. Their work is before them, and from which
they may not guiltlessly turn away.</p>
</div>

<p>I have spoken of the unfurling of the first American
battle flag. The following is Lincoln’s beautiful
acknowledgment of a flag sent him by some ladies
of a patriotic society:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Executive Mansion</span></p>

<p class="r"><i>Aug. 10, 1863</i></p>

<p>Permit me to return my grateful acknowledgements to
the fair manufacturer and generous donors of the beautiful
present which accompanies their note of the 20th July.
If anything could enhance to me the value of this representation
of our national ensign, so elegantly executed
and so gracefully bestowed, it would be the consideration
that its price has been devoted to the comfort and restoration
of those heroic men who have suffered and bled in our
flag’s defense. We never should, and I am sure, never
shall be niggard of gratitude and benefaction to the soldiers
who have endured toil, privations and wounds, that
the nation may live.</p>

<p class="r">Yours very truly,<br>

<span class="smcap">A. Lincoln</span></p>
</div>

<p>I do not want to be accused of waving too often
our emblem. But I must give in full two letters relating
to the Confederate flag. They are not particularly
valuable in a money sense, but I do not
think any amount would tempt me to sell them.
They are the kind that cannot fail to melt the
heart of an old bachelor with a fondness for children.
The first is addressed by General Leroy P. Walker,
Secretary of War in the Confederate Cabinet, to
General Beauregard, from Richmond, Virginia, September
14, 1861, and says:—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">My dear General</span>:</p>

<p>The enclosed note from my little daughter was written
by her without suggestion or alterations in any way, and
the design for a flag is entirely her own conception. She
has insisted so strongly on sending it to you that I did
not feel at liberty to refuse her. I consent the more
readily because I am sure you will appreciate it in the

<p>She signs herself with the usual vanity of her sex,
“daughter of the Secretary of War”, and this gives me
the opportunity to say that my official connection with
the Army is about to terminate, having tendered my
resignation to the President a few days since.</p>

<p>What I have done in this office has been honestly done,
and when the history of this war is written I feel that the
laggard justice of popular approval will be bestowed.</p>

<p>I send you a design entirely my own for a Confederate

<p>I feel that I must return for a moment to Lincoln.
Although I have letters of the greatest historical
import not only from the martyr President himself
but from nearly all his generals and members of his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</span>
cabinet, I prefer the notebook of Surgeon C. S. Taft,
who was at Lincoln’s bedside at the time of his
death. You can hear in it not only the last tragic
heartbeats of one of the truly great characters of all
time, but the knell of a soul-stirring epoch. The
meagre words that follow, extracted from the notebook,
are to me more moving than all the fine
writing in the world:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The wound ceased to bleed or discharge about 5.30 <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span>
and from that time the breathing was stertorous but
gradually increased in frequency and decreased in strength
up to the last breath, which was drawn at 21 minutes and
55 seconds after 7; the heart did not cease to beat until
22′ 10″ past 7; my hand was upon the President’s heart
and my eye upon the watch of the Surgeon General who
was standing by my side.</p>
</div>

<p>The finest character after Lincoln in the whole
Civil War was undoubtedly that great gentleman
and descendant of gentlemen, Robert E. Lee. From
my schooldays I had read of his life of nobility and
sorrow. The letter in which he resigned his commission,
addressed to General Winfield Scott, who
commanded the American Army, has always been
to me the highest example of patriotism and the
soldier’s ideal credo. The words, “save in defence
of my native State, I never desire again to draw my
sword,” have been indelibly impressed upon every
mind. I know of no letter that I would sooner
possess than this, but it was thirty years before I
could finally call it my own. I give it here without
further comment:—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Arlington, Washington City P. O.</span><br>
<i>20th April, 1861</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lieut. Gen. Winfield Scott,</span></p>

<p class="l"><span class="smcap">Com. Army</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">General</span>:—Since my interview with you on the 18th
inst., I have felt that I ought no longer to retain my commission
in the army. I therefore tender my resignation
which I request you will recommend for acceptance. It
would have been presented at once, but for the struggle
it has cost me to separate myself from the service to
which I have devoted all the best years of my life, all the
ability I possessed. During the whole of that time, more
than thirty years, I have experienced nothing but kindness
from my superiors, the most cordial friendship from
my companions. To no one General have I been so much
indebted as to yourself for uniform kindness and consideration,
and it had always been my urgent desire to
merit your approbation. I shall carry with me to the
grave the most grateful recollections of your kind consideration,
and your name and fame will always be dear
to me. Save in the defence of my native State, I never
desire again to draw my sword. Be pleased to accept my
most earnest wishes for the continuance of your happiness
and prosperity, and believe me most truly yours,</p>

<p class="r"><span class="smcap">Robert E. Lee</span></p>
</div>

<p>Four years elapsed. The war was over. General
Lee had surrendered. The following letter, which I
hold, to his old friend, General Beauregard, is one
of the finest letters ever written by the hand of man.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Lexington, Va.</span><br>
3rd <i>Oct.</i> ’65</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Gen.</span>:—</p>

<p>I am glad to see no indication in your letter of an intention
to leave the country. I think the South requires
the aid of her sons now, more than at any period of her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</span>
history. As you ask my purpose, I will state that I have
no thought of abandoning her, unless compelled to do so.</p>

<p>“After the surrender of the Southern Armies in April,
the revolution in the opinions &amp; feelings of the people,
seemed so complete, &amp; the return of the Southern States
into the union of all the States, so inevitable; that it became
in my opinion, the duty of every citizen, the Contest
being virtually ended, to cease opposition, &amp; place
himself in a position to serve the country. I therefore
upon the promulgation of the proclamation of Pres.
Johnson, which indicated apparently his policy in restoring
peace, determine to comply with its requirements;
&amp; on the 13 of June, applied to be embraced within its
provisions. I have not heard the result of my application,
but since then have been elected to the Presidency
of Washington College, &amp; have entered upon the duties
of the office, in the hope of being of some benefit to the
noble youth of our country.</p>

<p>“I need not tell you, that true patriotism requires of
men sometimes, to act exactly contrary at one period, to
that which it does at another; &amp; that the motive which
impels them, viz, the desire to do right, is precisely the
same. The circumstances which govern their actions undergo
change, and their conduct must conform to the
new order of things. History is full of illustrations of
this. Washington himself is an example, at one time he
fought against the French, under Braddock, in the service
of the King of Great Britain; at another he fought
with the French at Yorktown, under the orders of the
Continental Congress of America, against him. He has
not been branded by the world with reproach for this, but
his course has been applauded.</p>

<p>With sentiments of great esteem</p>

<p class="r1">I am most truly yours</p>

<p class="r"><span class="smcap">R. E. Lee</span></p>
</div>

<p>To me, Ulysses S. Grant has always been a gigantic
figure. He is probably the greatest general this country<span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</span>
has ever produced. Nowhere are his simplicity
and greatness better shown than in his letters. For
some reason they are not yet appreciated at their
proper worth, but the time will come when their
extraordinary merits will be recognized. They are
written in a direct style, free of all elaboration, not
unlike Lincoln’s, but without his peculiar felicity of
phrase. They are the words of a soldier, not a statesman.
Two of the letters which I have are, it seems
to me, without parallel for conciseness and beauty.
The first, written at the beginning of the war, is to
his father:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="right"><i>May</i> 30th, 1861<br>
<span class="smcap">Galena, Illinois</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Father</span>:—</p>

<p>I have now been home near a week, but return to
Springfield today. I have tendered my services to the
government and go today to make myself useful, if possible,
from this until our national difficulties are ended.
During the six days I have been at home, I have felt all
the time as if a duty was being neglected that was paramount
to any other duty I ever owed. I have every
reason to be well satisfied with myself for the services
already rendered but to stop now would not do.</p>

<p class="r1">Yours truly,</p>

<p class="r"><span class="smcap">U. S. Grant</span></p>

<p>The second, at the war’s end, is probably the
finest single document in private hands to-day, as
it is the original official telegram which ended the
greatest conflict in American history. Why I was
allowed to get this is one of the mysteries of collecting.
It should not be in the hands of any one
person, but ought to be in the safekeeping of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</span>Government. It was written in obvious haste, in his
own hand, at the moment General Lee surrendered,
on a page in the notebook of Grant’s orderly, General
Badeau.</p>

<p>The demand for things American is not a passing
fancy. It will increase in the same way as a stone
gathers moss. The prices now paid for early American
furniture, pottery, glass, and pictures are but an
indication of a movement yet in its infancy. Even
collectors in England, such as that eminent enthusiast,
Sir R. Leicester Harmsworth, Bart., are gathering
objects of interest relating to this country. It is
only meet and proper that Americans themselves
should tenderly cherish the primal, honest, unpretentious
things to which this country owes its
greatness.</p>
